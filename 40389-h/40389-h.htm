<h1>THE LIFE OF JOHN MARSHALL</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>INFLUENCE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION ON AMERICA</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Were there but an Adam and an Eve left in every country, and left free,
it would be better than it now is. (Jefferson.)</p>

<p>That malignant philosophy which can coolly and deliberately pursue,
through oceans of blood, abstract systems for the attainment of some fancied
untried good. (Marshall.)</p>

<p>The only genuine liberty consists in a mean equally distant from the despotism
of an individual and a million. ("Publicola": J. Q. Adams, 1792.)</p></div>


<p>The decision of the French King, Louis XVI, on
the advice of his Ministers, to weaken Great Britain
by aiding the Americans in their War for Independence,
while it accomplished its purpose, was fatal to
himself and to the Monarchy of France. As a result,
Great Britain lost America, but Louis lost his head.
Had not the Bourbon Government sent troops,
fleets, munitions, and money to the support of the
failing and desperate American fortunes, it is probable
that Washington would not have prevailed;
and the fires of the French holocaust which flamed
throughout the world surely would not have been
lit so soon.</p>

<p>The success of the American patriots in their
armed resistance to the rule of George III, although
brought about by the aid of the French Crown, was,
nevertheless, the shining and dramatic example
which Frenchmen imitated in beginning that vast
and elemental upheaval called the French Revolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>tion.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Thus the unnatural alliance in 1778 between
French Autocracy and American Liberty was one of
the great and decisive events of human history.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1789, that the American Republic
began its career under the forms of a National
Government, the curtain rose in France on that
tremendous drama which will forever engage the
interest of mankind. And just as the American
Revolution vitally influenced French opinion, so the
French Revolution profoundly affected American
thought; and, definitely, helped to shape those contending
forces in American life that are still waging
their conflict.</p>

<p>While the economic issue, so sharp in the adoption
of the Constitution, became still keener, as will
appear, after the National Government was established,
it was given a higher temper in the forge of
the French Revolution. American history, especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of the period now under consideration, can be read
correctly only by the lights that shine from that
titanic smithy; can be understood only by considering
the effect upon the people, the thinkers, and the
statesmen of America, of the deeds done and words
spoken in France during those inspiring if monstrous
years.</p>

<p>The naturally conservative or radical temperaments
of men in America were hardened by every
episode of the French convulsion. The events in
France, at this time, operated upon men like Hamilton
on the one hand, and Jefferson on the other
hand, in a fashion as deep and lasting as it was
antagonistic and antipodal; and the intellectual and
moral phenomena, manifested in picturesque guise
among the people in America, impressed those who
already were, and those who were to become, the
leaders of American opinion, as much as the events
of the Gallic cataclysm itself.</p>

<p>George Washington at the summit of his fame,
and John Marshall just beginning his ascent, were
alike confirmed in that non-popular tendency of
thought and feeling which both avowed in the dark
years between our War for Independence and the
adoption of our Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In reviewing all
the situations, not otherwise to be fully understood,
that arose from the time Washington became President
until Marshall took his seat as Chief Justice, we
must have always before our eyes the extraordinary
scenes and consider the delirious emotions which
the French Revolution produced in America. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
must be constantly borne in mind that Americans of
the period now under discussion did not and could
not look upon it with present-day knowledge, perspective,
or calmness. What is here set down is,
therefore, an attempt to portray the effects of that
volcanic eruption of human forces upon the minds
and hearts of those who witnessed, from across the
ocean, its flames mounting to the heavens and its
lava pouring over the whole earth.</p>

<p>Unless this portrayal is given, a blank must be left
in a recital of the development of American radical
and conservative sentiment and of the formation of
the first of American political parties. Certainly for
the purposes of the present work, an outline, at least,
of the effect of the French Revolution on American
thought and feeling is indispensable. Just as the
careers of Marshall and Jefferson are inseparably
intertwined, and as neither can be fully understood
without considering the other, so the American by-products
of the French Revolution must be examined
if we would comprehend either of these great protagonists
of hostile theories of democratic government.</p>

<p>At first everybody in America heartily approved
the French reform movement. Marshall describes
for us this unanimous approbation. "A great revolution
had commenced in that country," he writes,
"the first stage of which was completed by limiting
the powers of the monarch, and by the establishment
of a popular assembly. In no part of the
globe was this revolution hailed with more joy
than in America. The influence it would have on
the affairs of the world was not then distinctly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
foreseen; and the philanthropist, without becoming
a political partisan, rejoiced in the event. On this
subject, therefore, but one sentiment existed."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson had written from Paris, a short time
before leaving for America: "A complete revolution
in this [French] government, has been effected
merely by the force of public opinion; ... and this
revolution has not cost a single life."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> So little
did his glowing mind then understand the forces
which he had helped set in motion. A little later
he advises Madison of the danger threatening the reformed
French Government, but adds, reassuringly,
that though "the lees ... of the patriotic party
[the French radical party] of wicked principles &amp;
desperate fortunes" led by Mirabeau who "is the
chief ... may produce a temporary confusion ...
they cannot have success ultimately. The King,
the mass of the substantial people of the whole
country, the army, and the influential part of the
clergy, form a firm phalanx which must prevail."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>So, in the beginning, all American newspapers,
now more numerous, were exultant. "Liberty will
have another feather in her cap.... The ensuing
winter [1789] will be the commencement of a Golden
Age,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was the glowing prophecy of an enthusiastic
Boston journal. Those two sentences of the New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
England editor accurately stated the expectation
and belief of all America.</p>

<p>But in France itself one American had grave misgivings
as to the outcome. "The materials for a revolution
in this country are very indifferent. Everybody
agrees that there is an utter prostration of
morals; but this general position can never convey
to an American mind the degree of depravity.... A
hundred thousand examples are required to show the
extreme rottenness.... The virtuous ... stand forward
from a background deeply and darkly shaded....
From such crumbling matter ... the great edifice
of freedom is to be erected here [in France]....
[There is] a perfect indifference to the violation of
engagements.... Inconstancy is mingled in the
blood, marrow, and very essence of this people....
Consistency is a phenomenon.... The great mass
of the common people have ... no morals but their
interest. These are the creatures who, led by drunken
curates, are now in the high road <i>&agrave; la libert&eacute;</i>."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Such was the report sent to Washington by Gouverneur
Morris, the first American Minister to
France under the Constitution.</p>

<p>Three months later Morris, writing officially, declares
that "this country is ... as near to anarchy
as society can approach without dissolution."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> And
yet, a year earlier, Lafayette had lamented the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
French public's indifference to much needed reforms;
"The people ... have been so dull that it has
made me sick" was Lafayette's doleful account of
popular enthusiasm for liberty in the France of
1788.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Gouverneur Morris wrote Robert Morris that a
French owner of a quarry demanded damages because
so many bodies had been dumped into the
quarry that they "choked it up so that he could not
get men to work at it." These victims, declared the
American Minister, had been "the best people,"
killed "without form of trial, and their bodies thrown
like dead dogs into the first hole that offered."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Gouverneur
Morris's diary abounds in such entries as
"[Sept. 2, 1792] the murder of the priests, ... murder
of prisoners,... [Sept. 3] The murdering continues
all day.... [Sept. 4th].... And still the
murders continue."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>John Marshall was now the attorney of Robert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Morris; was closely connected with him in business
transactions; and, as will appear, was soon to become
his relative by the marriage of Marshall's
brother to the daughter of the Philadelphia financier.
Gouverneur Morris, while not related to
Robert Morris, was "entirely devoted" to and
closely associated with him in business; and both
were in perfect agreement of opinions.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Thus the
reports of the scarlet and revolting phases of the
French Revolution that came to the Virginia lawyer
were carried through channels peculiarly personal
and intimate.</p>

<p>They came, too, from an observer who was thoroughly
aristocratic in temperament and conviction.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Little of appreciation or understanding of the basic
causes and high purposes of the French Revolution
appears in Gouverneur Morris's accounts and comments,
while he portrays the horrible in unrelieved
ghastliness.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Such, then, were the direct and first-hand accounts
that Marshall received; and the impression
made upon him was correspondingly dark, and as
lasting as it was somber. Of this, Marshall himself
leaves us in no doubt. Writing more than a
decade later he gives his estimate of Gouverneur
Morris and of his accounts of the French Revolution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"The private correspondence of Mr. Morris with
the president [and, of course, much more so with
Robert Morris] exhibits a faithful picture, drawn
by the hand of a master, of the shifting revolutionary
scenes which with unparalleled rapidity succeeded
each other in Paris. With the eye of an
intelligent, and of an unimpassioned observer, he
marked all passing events, and communicated them
with fidelity. He did not mistake despotism for
freedom, because it was sanguinary, because it was
exercised by those who denominated themselves the
people, or because it assumed the name of liberty.
Sincerely wishing happiness and a really free government
to France, he could not be blind to the obvious
truth that the road to those blessings had
been mistaken."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Everybody in America echoed the shouts of the
Parisian populace when the Bastille fell. Was it not
the prison where kings thrust their subjects to
perish of starvation and torture?<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Lafayette, "as
a missionary of liberty to its patriarch," hastened
to present Washington with "the main key of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
fortress of despotism."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Washington responded that
he accepted the key of the Bastille as "a token of the
victory gained by liberty."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Thomas Paine wrote
of his delight at having been chosen by Lafayette
to "convey ... the first ripe fruits of American
principles, transplanted into Europe, to his master
and patron."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Mutual congratulations were carried
back and forth by every ship.</p>

<p>Soon the mob in Paris took more sanguinary action
and blood flowed more freely, but not in sufficient
quantity to quench American enthusiasm for the
cause of liberty in France. We had had plenty of
mobs ourselves and much crimson experience. Had
not mobs been the precursors of our own Revolution?</p>

<p>The next developments of the French uprising
and the appearance of the Jacobin Clubs, however,
alarmed some and gave pause to all of the
cautious friends of freedom in America and other
countries.</p>

<p>Edmund Burke hysterically sounded the alarm.
On account of his championship of the cause of
American Independence, Burke had enjoyed much
credit with all Americans who had heard of him.
"In the last age," exclaimed Burke in Parliament,
February 9, 1790, "we were in danger of being entangled
by the example of France in the net of a
relentless despotism.... Our present danger from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the example of a people whose character knows no
medium, is, with regard to government, a danger
from anarchy; a danger of being led, through an
admiration of successful fraud and violence, to an
imitation of the excesses of an irrational, unprincipled,
proscribing, confiscating, plundering, ferocious,
bloody, and tyrannical democracy."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Of the French declaration of human rights Burke
declared: "They made and recorded a sort of <i>institute</i>
and <i>digest</i> of anarchy, called the rights of
man, in such a pedantic abuse of elementary principles
as would have disgraced boys at school....
They systematically destroyed every hold of authority
by opinion, religious or civil, on the minds
of the people.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>... On the scheme of this barbarous
philosophy, which is the offspring of cold hearts
and muddy understandings," exclaimed the great
English liberal, "laws are to be supported only by
their own terrours.... In the groves of <i>their</i> academy,
at the end of every vista, you see nothing but
the gallows."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Burke's extravagant rhetoric, although reprinted
in America, was little heeded. It would have been
better if his pen had remained idle. For Burke's
wild language, not yet justified by the orgy of blood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
in which French liberty was, later, to be baptized,
caused a voice to speak to which America did listen,
a page to be written that America did read. Thomas
Paine, whose "Common Sense" had made his name
better known to all people in the United States than
that of any other man of his time except Washington,
Franklin, Jefferson, and Henry, was then in
France. This stormy petrel of revolution seems always
to have been drawn by instinct to every part of
the human ocean where hurricanes were brooding.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Paine answered Burke with that ferocious indictment
of monarchy entitled "The Rights of Man,"
in which he went as far to one extreme as the English
political philosopher had gone to the other; for
while Paine annihilated Burke's Brahminic laudation
of rank, title, and custom, he also penned a
doctrine of paralysis to all government. As was the
case with his "Common Sense," Paine's "Rights
of Man" abounded in attractive epigrams and striking
sentences which quickly caught the popular ear
and were easily retained by the shallowest memory.</p>

<p>"The cause of the French people is that of ... the
whole world," declared Paine in the preface of his
flaming essay;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and then, the sparks beginning to
fly from his pen, he wrote: "Great part of that order
which reigns among mankind is not the effect of
government.... It existed prior to government,
and would exist if the formality of government was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
abolished.... The instant formal government is
abolished," said he, "society begins to act; ... and
common interest produces common security." And
again: "The more perfect civilization is, the less
occasion has it for government.... It is but few
general laws that civilised life requires."</p>

<p>Holding up our own struggle for liberty as an
illustration, Paine declared: "The American Revolution ... laid open the imposition of governments";
and, using our newly formed and untried National
Government as an example, he asserted with grotesque
inaccuracy: "In America ... all the parts
are brought into cordial unison. There the poor are
not oppressed, the rich are not privileged.... Their
taxes are few, because their government is just."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Proceeding thence to his assault upon all other
established governments, especially that of England,
the great iconoclast exclaimed: "It is impossible
that such governments as have hitherto [1790] existed
in the world, could have commenced by any
other means than a violation of every principle
sacred and moral."</p>

<p>Striking at the foundations of all permanent authority,
Paine declared that "Every age and generation
must be ... free to act for itself <i>in all cases</i>....
The vanity and presumption of governing beyond
the grave is the most ridiculous and insolent
of all tyrannies." The people of yesterday have
"no right ... to bind or to control ... the people
of the present day ... <i>in any shape whatever</i>....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Every generation is, and must be, competent to all
the purposes which its occasions require."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> So wrote
the incomparable pamphleteer of radicalism.</p>

<p>Paine's essay, issued in two parts, was a torch
successively applied to the inflammable emotions of
the American masses. Most newspapers printed in
each issue short and appealing excerpts from it. For
example, the following sentence from Paine's "Rights
of Man" was reproduced in the "Columbian Centinel"
of Boston on June 6, 1792: "Can we possibly
suppose that if government had originated in right
principles and had not an interest in pursuing a wrong
one, that the world could have been in the wretched
and quarrelsome condition it is?" Such quotations
from Paine appeared in all radical and in some
conservative American publications; and they were
repeated from mouth to mouth until even the backwoodsmen
knew of them&mdash;and believed them.</p>

<p>"Our people ... love what you write and read it
with delight" ran the message which Jefferson sent
across the ocean to Paine. "The printers," continued
Jefferson, "season every newspaper with
extracts from your last, as they did before from
your first part of the <i>Rights of Man</i>. They have both
served here to separate the wheat from the chaff....
Would you believe it possible that in this country
there should be high &amp; important characters<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> who
need your lessons in republicanism &amp; who do not
heed them. It is but too true that we have a sect
preaching up &amp; pouting after an English constitu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>tion
of king, lords, &amp; commons, &amp; whose heads are
itching for crowns, coronets &amp; mitres....</p>

<p>"Go on then," Jefferson urged Paine, "in doing
with your pen what in other times was done with
the sword, ... and be assured that it has not a
more sincere votary nor you a more ardent well-wisher
than ... Tho<sup>s&#803;</sup> Jefferson."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>And the wheat was being separated from the
chaff, as Jefferson declared. Shocked not more by
the increasing violence in France than by the principles
which Paine announced, men of moderate
mind and conservative temperament in America
came to have misgivings about the French Revolution,
and began to speak out against its doings and
its doctrines.</p>

<p>A series of closely reasoned and well-written articles
were printed in the "Columbian Centinel" of
Boston in the summer of 1791, over the <i>nom de
guerre</i> "Publicola"; and these were widely copied.
They were ascribed to the pen of John Adams, but
were the work of his brilliant son.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The American edition of Paine's "Rights of Man"
was headed by a letter from Secretary of State Jefferson
to the printer, stating his pleasure that the
essay was to be printed in this country and "that
something is at length to be publickly said against
the political heresies which have sprung up among
us."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Publicola called attention to this and thus,
more conspicuously, displayed Jefferson as an advocate
of Paine's doctrines.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>All Americans had "seen with pleasure the temples
of despotism levelled with the ground," wrote
the keen young Boston law student.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> There was
"but one sentiment...&mdash;that of exultation." But
what did Jefferson mean by "heresies"? asked Publicola.
Was Paine's pamphlet "the canonical book
of scripture?" If so, what were its doctrines? "That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
which a whole nation chooses to do, it has a right
to do" was one of them.</p>

<p>Was that "principle" sound? No! avowed Publicola,
for "the eternal and immutable laws of justice
and of morality are paramount to all human legislation."
A nation might have the power but never
the right to violate these. Even majorities have no
right to do as they please; if so, what security has
the individual citizen? Under the unrestrained rule
of the majority "the principles of liberty must still
be the sport of arbitrary power, and the hideous
form of despotism must lay aside the diadem and the
scepter, only to assume the party-colored garments
of democracy."</p>

<p>"The only genuine liberty consists in a mean
equally distant from the despotism of an individual
and of a million," asserted Publicola. "Mr. Paine
seems to think it as easy for a nation to change its
government as for a man to change his coat." But
"the extreme difficulty which impeded the progress
of its [the American Constitution's] adoption ...
exhibits the fullest evidence of what a more than
Herculean task it is to unite the opinions of a free
people on any system of government whatever."</p>

<p>The "mob" which Paine exalted as the common
people, but which Publicola thought was really only
the rabble of the cities, "can be brought to act in
concert" only by "a frantic enthusiasm and ungovernable
fury; their profound ignorance and deplorable
credulity make them proper tools for any man
who can inflame their passions; ... and," warned
Publicola, "as they have nothing to lose by the total<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
dissolution of civil society, their rage may be easily
directed against any victim which may be pointed
out to them.... To set in motion this inert mass,
the eccentric vivacity of a madman is infinitely better
calculated than the sober coolness of phlegmatic
reason."</p>

<p>"Where," asked Publicola, "is the power that
should control them [Congress]?" if they violate the
letter of the Constitution. Replying to his own
question, he asserted that the real check on Congress
"is the spirit of the people."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> John Marshall
had said the same thing in the Virginia Constitutional
Convention; but even at that early period
the Richmond attorney went further and flatly
declared that the temporary "spirit of the people"
was not infallible and that the Supreme Court could
and would declare void an unconstitutional act of
Congress&mdash;a truth which he was, unguessed at
that time by himself or anybody else, to announce
with conclusive power within a few years and at
an hour when dissolution confronted the forming
Nation.</p>

<p>Such is a rapid <i>pr&eacute;cis</i> of the conservative essays
written by the younger Adams. Taken together,
they were a rallying cry to those who dared to
brave the rising hurricane of American sympathy
with the French Revolution; but they also strengthened
the force of that growing storm. Multitudes
of writers attacked Publicola as the advocate of
"aristocracy" and "monarchy." "The papers under
the signature of <span class="smcap">Publicola</span> have called forth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
a torrent of abuse," declared the final essay of the
series.</p>

<p>Brown's "Federal Gazette" of Philadelphia
branded Publicola's doctrines as "abominable heresies";
and hoped that they would "not procure
many proselytes either to <i>monarchy</i> or <i>aristocracy</i>."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
The "Independent Chronicle" of Boston asserted
that Publicola was trying to build up a "system
of <span class="smcap">Monarchy and Aristocracy</span> ... on the ruins
both of the <span class="smcap">Reputation</span> and <span class="smcap">Liberties</span> of the
<span class="smcap">People</span>."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Madison reported to Jefferson that because
of John Adams's reputed authorship of these
unpopular letters, the supporters of the Massachusetts
statesman had become "perfectly insignificant
in ... number" and that "in Boston he
is ... distinguished for his unpopularity."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In such fashion the controversy began in America
over the French Revolution.</p>

<p>But whatever the misgivings of the conservative,
whatever the alarm of the timid, the overwhelming
majority of Americans were for the French Revolution
and its doctrines;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and men of the highest
ability and station gave dignity to the voice of the
people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>In most parts of the country politicians who
sought election to public office conformed, as usual,
to the popular view. It would appear that the prevailing
sentiment was influential even with so strong
a conservative and extreme a Nationalist as Madison,
in bringing about his amazing reversal of views
which occurred soon after the Constitution was
adopted.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But those who, like Marshall, were not
shaken, were made firmer in their opinions by the
very strength of the ideas thus making headway
among the masses.</p>

<p>An incident of the French Revolution almost
within sight of the American coast gave to the dogma
of equality a new and intimate meaning in the eyes
of those who had begun to look with disfavor upon
the results of Gallic radical thought. Marshall and
Jefferson best set forth the opposite impressions
made by this dramatic event.</p>

<p>"Early and bitter fruits of that malignant philosophy,"
writes Marshall, "which ... can coolly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and deliberately pursue, through oceans of blood,
abstract systems for the attainment of some fancied
untried good, were gathered in the French West
Indies.... The revolutionists of France formed the
mad and wicked project of spreading their doctrines
of equality among persons [negroes and white people]
between whom distinctions and prejudices exist
to be subdued only by the grave. The rage excited
by the pursuit of this visionary and baneful theory,
after many threatening symptoms, burst forth on
the 23d day of August 1791, with a fury alike destructive
and general.</p>

<p>"In one night, a preconcerted insurrection of the
blacks took place throughout the colony of St.
Domingo; and the white inhabitants of the country,
while sleeping in their beds, were involved in one
indiscriminate massacre, from which neither age nor
sex could afford an exemption. Only a few females,
reserved for a fate more cruel than death, were intentionally
spared; and not many were fortunate
enough to escape into the fortified cities. The insurgents
then assembled in vast numbers, and a
bloody war commenced between them and the
whites inhabiting the towns."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>After the African disciples of French liberty
had overthrown white supremacy in St. Domingo,
Jefferson wrote his daughter that he had been informed
"that the Patriotic party [St. Domingo revolutionists]
had taken possession of 600 aristocrats
&amp; monocrats, had sent 200 of them to France, &amp;
were sending 400 here.... I wish," avowed Jef<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>ferson,
in this intimate family letter, "we could
distribute our 400 [white French exiles] among the
Indians, who would teach them lessons of liberty
&amp; equality."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Events in France marched swiftly from one bloody
climax to another still more scarlet. All were faithfully
reflected in the views of the people of the
United States. John Marshall records for us "the
fervour of democracy" as it then appeared in our
infant Republic. He repeats that, at first, every
American wished success to the French reformers.
But the later steps of the movement "impaired
this ... unanimity of opinion.... A few who had
thought deeply on the science of government ...
believed that ... the influence of the galleries over
the legislature, and of mobs over the executive; ... the tumultuous assemblages of the people and
their licentious excesses ... did not appear to be
the symptoms of a healthy constitution, or of genuine
freedom.... They doubted, and they feared
for the future."</p>

<p>Of the body of American public opinion, however,
Marshall chronicles that: "In total opposition to this
sentiment was that of the public. There seems to
be something infectious in the example of a powerful
and enlightened nation verging towards democracy,
which imposes on the human mind, and
leads human reason in fetters.... Long settled
opinions yield to the overwhelming weight of such
dazzling authority. It wears the semblance of be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>ing
the sense of mankind, breaking loose from the
shackles which had been imposed by artifice, and
asserting the freedom, and the dignity, of his
nature."</p>

<p>American conservative writers, says Marshall,
"were branded as the advocates of royalty, and of
aristocracy. To question the duration of the present
order of things [in France] was thought to evidence
an attachment to unlimited monarchy, or a blind
prejudice in favour of British institutions.... The
war in which the several potentates of Europe were
engaged against France, although in almost every
instance declared by that power, was pronounced
to be a war for the extirpation of human liberty, and
for the banishment of free government from the face
of the earth. The preservation of the constitution
of the United States was supposed to depend on its
issue; and the coalition against France was treated
as a coalition against America also."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Marshall states, more clearly, perhaps, than any
one else, American conservative opinion of the
time: "The circumstances under which the abolition
of royalty was declared, the massacres which
preceded it, the scenes of turbulence and violence
which were acted in every part of the nation, appeared
to them [American conservatives] to present
an awful and doubtful state of things.... The
idea that a republic was to be introduced and supported
by force, was, to them, a paradox in politics."</p>

<p>Thus it was, he declares, that "the French revolution
will be found to have had great influence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
on the strength of parties, and on the subsequent
political transactions of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>As the French storm increased, its winds blew
ever stronger over the responsive waters of American
opinion. Jefferson, that accurate barometer of public
weather, thus registers the popular feeling: "The
sensations it [the French Revolution] has produced
here, and the indications of them in the public papers,
have shown that the form our own government was
to take depended much more on the events of France
than anybody had before imagined."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Thus both
Marshall and Jefferson bear testimony as to the
determining effect produced in America by the violent
change of systems in France.</p>

<p>William Short, whom Jefferson had taken to
France as his secretary, when he was the American
Minister to France, and who, when Jefferson returned
to the United States, remained as <i>charg&eacute;
d'affaires</i>,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> had written both officially and privately
of what was going on in France and of the increasing
dominance of the Jacobin Clubs.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Perhaps no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
more trustworthy statement exists of the prevailing
American view of the French cataclysm than that
given in Jefferson's fatherly letter to his prot&eacute;g&eacute;:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The tone of your letters had for some time given
me pain," wrote Jefferson, "on account of the extreme
warmth with which they censured the proceedings
of the Jacobins of France.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>... Many
guilty persons [aristocrats] fell without the forms
of trial, and with them some innocent:... It was
necessary to use the arm of the people, a machine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
not quite so blind as balls and bombs, but blind to
a certain degree....</p>

<p>"The liberty of the whole earth," continued Jefferson,
"was depending on the issue of the contest,
and was ever such a prize won with so little innocent
blood? My own affections have been deeply wounded
by some of the martyrs to this cause, but rather than
it should have failed, I would have seen half the
earth desolated.</p>

<p>"Were there but an Adam &amp; an Eve left in every
country, &amp; left free, it would be better than as it now
is," declared Jefferson; and "my sentiments ... are
really those of 99 in an hundred of our citizens," was
that careful political observer's estimate of American
public opinion. "Your temper of mind," Jefferson
cautions Short, "would be extremely disrelished if
known to your countrymen.</p>

<p>"There are in the U.S. some characters of opposite
principles.... Excepting them, this country is
entirely republican, friends to the constitution....
The little party above mentioned have espoused
it only as a stepping stone to monarchy.... The
successes of republicanism in France have given the
coup de grace to their prospects, and I hope to their
projects.</p>

<p>"I have developed to you faithfully the sentiments
of your country," Jefferson admonishes Short, "that
you may govern yourself accordingly."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Jefferson's count of the public pulse was accurate.
"The people of this country [Virginia] ... are
unanimous &amp; explicit in their sympathy with the
Revolution" was the weather-wise Madison's report.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
And the fever was almost as high in other
States.</p>

<p>When, after many executions of persons who had
been "denounced" on mere suspicion of unfriendliness
to the new order of things, the neck of Louis
XVI was finally laid beneath the knife of the guillotine
and the royal head rolled into the executioner's
basket, even Thomas Paine was shocked.
In a judicious letter to Danton he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I now despair of seeing the great object of
European liberty accomplished" because of "the
tumultuous misconduct" of "the present revolution"
which "injure[s its] character ... and discourage[s]
the progress of liberty all over the world....
There ought to be some regulation with respect to
the spirit of denunciation that now prevails."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>So it was that Thomas Paine, in France, came to
speak privately the language which, in America, at
that very hour, was considered by his disciples to
be the speech of "aristocracy," "monarchy," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
"despotism"; for the red fountains which drenched
the fires of even Thomas Paine's enthusiasm did not
extinguish the flames his burning words had lighted
among the people of the United States. Indeed
Paine, himself, was attacked for regretting the execution
of the King.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Three months after the execution of the French
King, the new Minister of the French Republic,
"Citizen" Gen&ecirc;t, arrived upon our shores. He
landed, not at Philadelphia, then our seat of government,
but at Charleston, South Carolina. The
youthful<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> representative of Revolutionary France
was received by public officials with obsequious
flattery and by the populace with a frenzy of enthusiasm
almost indescribable in its intensity.</p>

<p>He acted on the welcome. He fitted out privateers,
engaged seamen, issued letters of marque and reprisal,
administered to American citizens oaths of
"allegiance" to the authority then reigning in Paris.
All this was done long before he presented his
credentials to the American Government. His progress
to our Capital was an unbroken festival of
triumph. Washington's dignified restraint was interpreted
as hostility, not only to Gen&ecirc;t, but also
to "liberty." But if Washington's heart was ice, the
people's heart was fire.</p>

<p>"We expect Mr. Genest here within a few days,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
wrote Jefferson, just previous to the appearance of
the French Minister in Philadelphia and before our
ignored and offended President had even an opportunity
to receive him. "It seems," Jefferson continued,
"as if his arrival would furnish occasion for
the <i>people</i> to testify their affections without respect
to the cold caution of their government."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Again Jefferson measured popular sentiment accurately.
Gen&ecirc;t was made an idol by the people.
Banquets were given in his honor and extravagant
toasts were drunk to the Republic and the guillotine.
Showers of fiery "poems" filled the literary air.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
"What hugging and tugging! What addressing
and caressing! What mountebanking and chanting!
with liberty caps and other wretched trumpery of
<i>sans culotte</i> foolery!" exclaimed a disgusted conservative.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>While all this was going on in America, Robespierre,
as the incarnation of liberty, equality, and
fraternity in France, achieved the summit of power
and "The Terror" reached high tide. Marie Antoinette
met the fate of her royal husband, and the
executioners, overworked, could not satisfy the lust
of the Parisian populace for human life. All this,
however, did not extinguish American enthusiasm
for French liberty.</p>

<p>Responding to the wishes of their subscribers, who
at that period were the only support of the press, the
Republican newspapers suppressed such atrocities
as they could, but when concealment was impossible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
they defended the deeds they chronicled.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It was a
losing game to do otherwise, as one of the few
journalistic supporters of the American Government
discovered to his sorrow. Fenno, the editor of the
"Gazette of the United States," found opposition to
French revolutionary ideas, in addition to his support
of Hamilton's popularly detested financial
measures,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> too much for him. The latter was load
enough; but the former was the straw that broke the
conservative editor's back.</p>

<p>"I am ... incapacitate[d] ... from printing another
paper without the aid of a considerable loan,"
wrote the bankrupt newspaper opponent of French
doctrines and advocate of Washington's Administration.
"Since the 18th September, [1793] I have rec'd
only 35&frac14; dollars," Fenno lamented. "Four years &amp;
an half of my life is gone for nothing; &amp; worse (for I
have a Debt of 2500 Dollars on my Shoulders), if
at this crisis the hand of benevolence &amp; <i>patriotism</i>
is not extended."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Forgotten by the majority of Americans was the
assistance which the demolished French Monarchy
and the decapitated French King had given the
American army when, but for that assistance, our
cause had been lost. The effigy of Louis XVI was
guillotined by the people, many times every day in
Philadelphia, on the same spot where, ten years before,
as a monument of their gratitude, these same
patriots had erected a triumphal arch, decorated
with the royal lilies of France bearing the motto,
"They exceed in glory," surmounted by a bust of
Louis inscribed, "His merit makes us remember
him."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>At a dinner in Philadelphia upon the anniversary
of the French King's execution, the dead monarch
was represented by a roasted pig. Its head was cut
off at the table, and each guest, donning the liberty
cap, shouted "tyrant" as with his knife he chopped
the sundered head of the dead swine.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The news of
the beheading of Louis's royal consort met with a
like reception. "I have heard more than one young
woman under the age of twenty declare," testifies
Cobbett, "that they would willingly have dipped
their hands in the blood of the queen of France."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>But if the host of American radicals whom Jefferson
led and whose spirit he so truly interpreted
were forgetful of the practical friendship of French
Royalty in our hour of need, American conservatives,
among whom Marshall was developing leadership,
were also unmindful of the dark crimes against the
people which, at an earlier period, had stained the
Monarchy of France and gradually cast up the account
that brought on the inevitable settlement of
the Revolution. The streams of blood that flowed
were waters of Lethe to both sides.</p>

<p>Yet to both they were draughts which produced
in one an obsession of reckless unrestraint and in
the other a terror of popular rule no less exaggerated.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Of the latter class, Marshall was, by far, the
most moderate and balanced, although the tragic
aspect of the convulsion in which French liberty
was born, came to him in an especially direct fashion,
as we have seen from the Morris correspondence
already cited.</p>

<p>Another similar influence on Marshall was the case
of Lafayette. The American partisans of the French
Revolution accused this man, who had fought for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
us in our War for Independence, of deserting the
cause of liberty because he had striven to hold the
Gallic uprising within orderly bounds. When, for
this, he had been driven from his native land and
thrown into a foreign dungeon, Freneau thus sang
the conviction of the American majority:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Here, bold in arms, and firm in heart,<br />
He help'd to gain our cause,<br />
Yet could not from a tyrant part,<br />
But, turn'd to embrace his laws!"<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Lafayette's expulsion by his fellow Republicans
and his imprisonment by the allied monarchs, was
brought home to John Marshall in a very direct and
human fashion. His brother, James M. Marshall,
was sent by Washington<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> as his personal representative,
to plead unofficially for Lafayette's release.
Marshall tells us of the strong and tender personal
friendship between Washington and Lafayette
and of the former's anxiety for the latter. But,
writes Marshall: "The extreme jealousy with which
the persons who administered the government of
France, as well as a large party in America, watched
his [Washington's] deportment towards all those
whom the ferocious despotism of the jacobins had
exiled from their country" rendered "a formal
interposition in favour of the virtuous and unfortunate
victim [Lafayette] of their furious passions ...
unavailing."</p>

<p>Washington instructed our ministers to do all they
could "unofficially" to help Lafayette, says Marshall;
and "a confidential person [Marshall's brother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
James] had been sent to Berlin to solicit his discharge:
but before this messenger had reached his
destination, the King of Prussia had delivered over
his illustrious prisoner to the Emperor of Germany."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Washington tried "to obtain the powerful mediation
of Britain" and hoped "that the cabinet of St. James
would take an interest in the case; but this hope was
soon dissipated." Great Britain would do nothing to
secure from her allies Lafayette's release.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Thus Marshall, in an uncommonly personal way,
was brought face to face with what appeared to him
to be the injustice of the French revolutionists. Lafayette,
under whom John Marshall had served at
Brandywine and Monmouth; Lafayette, leader of
the movement in France for a free government like
our own; Lafayette, hated by kings and aristocrats
because he loved genuine liberty, and yet exiled
from his own country by his own countrymen for
the same reason<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>&mdash;this picture, which was the one
Marshall saw, influenced him profoundly and permanently.</p>

<p>Humor as well as horror contributed to the repugnance
which Marshall and men of his type felt
ever more strongly for what they considered to be
mere popular caprice. The American passion for
equality had its comic side. The public hatred of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
rank did not stop with French royalty and nobility.
Because of his impassioned plea in Parliament for the
American cause, a statue of Lord Chatham had been
erected at Charleston, South Carolina; the people
now suspended it by the neck in the air until the
sculptured head was severed from the body. But
Chatham was dead and knew only from the spirit
world of this recognition of his bold words in behalf
of the American people in their hour of trial and of
need. In Virginia the statue of Lord Botetourt was
beheaded.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This nobleman was also long since deceased,
guilty of no fault but an effort to help the
colonists, more earnest than some other royal governors
had displayed. Still, in life, he had been
called a "lord"; so off with the head of his statue!</p>

<p>In the cities, streets were renamed. "Royal Exchange
Alley" in Boston became "Equality Lane";
and "Liberty Stump" was the name now given to
the base of a tree that formerly had been called
"Royal." In New York, "<i>Queen Street</i> became
<i>Pearl Street</i>; and <i>King Street</i>, Liberty Street."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The
liberty cap was the popular headgear and everybody
wore the French cockade. Even the children, thus
decorated, marched in processions,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> singing, in a
mixture of French and English words, the meaning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of which they did not in the least understand, the
glories of "libert&eacute;, &eacute;galit&eacute;, fraternit&eacute;."</p>

<p>At a town meeting in Boston resolutions asking
that a city charter be granted were denounced as an
effort to "destroy the liberties of the people; ... a
link in the chain of aristocratic influence."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Titles
were the especial aversion of the masses. Even before
the formation of our government, the people had
shown their distaste for all formalities, and especially
for terms denoting official rank; and, after the
Constitution was adopted, one of the first things
Congress did was to decide against any form of address
to the President. Adams and Lee had favored
some kind of respectful designation of public officials.
This all-important subject had attracted the
serious thought of the people more than had the
form of government, foreign policy, or even taxes.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Washington taken his oath of office
when David Stuart warned him that "nothing could
equal the ferment and disquietude occasioned by the
proposition respecting titles. As it is believed to have
originated from Mr. Adams and Mr. Lee, they are
not only unpopular to an extreme, but highly odious....
It has given me much pleasure to hear every
part of your conduct spoken of with high approbation,
and particularly your dispensing with ceremony,
occasionally walking the streets; while Adams
is never seen but in his carriage and six. As trivial
as this may appear," writes Stuart, "it appears to
be more captivating to the generality, than matters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of more importance. Indeed, I believe the great
herd of mankind form their judgments of characters,
more from such slight occurrences, than those of
greater magnitude."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>This early hostility to ostentation and rank now
broke forth in rabid virulence. In the opinion of the
people, as influenced by the French Revolution, a
Governor or President ought not to be referred to
as "His Excellency"; nor a minister of the gospel
as "Reverend." Even "sir" or "esquire" were,
plainly, "monarchical." The title "Honorable" or
"His Honor," when applied to any official, even a
judge, was base pandering to aristocracy. "Mr."
and "Mrs." were heretical to the new religion of
equality. Nothing but "citizen"<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> would do&mdash;citizen
judge, citizen governor, citizen clergyman,
citizen colonel, major, or general, citizen baker,
shoemaker, banker, merchant, and farmer,&mdash;citizen
everybody.</p>

<p>To address the master of ceremonies at a dinner
or banquet or other public gathering as "Mr. Chairman"
or "Mr. Toastmaster" was aristocratic: only
"citizen chairman" or "citizen toastmaster" was the
true speech of genuine liberty.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> And the name of the
<i>Greek</i> letter college fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa, was
the trick of kings to ensnare our unsuspecting youth.
Even "&#934;.&#914;.&#922;." was declared to be "an infringement
of the natural rights of society." A college fraternity
was destructive of the spirit of equality in American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
colleges.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> "<i>L&egrave;se-r&eacute;publicanisme</i>" was the term applied
to good manners and politeness.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Such were the surface and harmless evidences of
the effect of the French Revolution on the great mass
of American opinion. But a serious and practical
result developed. Starting with the mother organization
at Philadelphia, secret societies sprang up all
over the Union in imitation of the Jacobin Clubs of
France. Each society had its corresponding committee;
and thus these organizations were welded
into an unbroken chain. Their avowed purpose was
to cherish the principles of human freedom and to
spread the doctrine of true republicanism. But they
soon became practical political agencies; and then,
like their French prototype, the sowers of disorder
and the instigators of insurrection.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The practical activities of these organizations
aroused, at last, the open wrath of Washington.
They "are spreading mischief far and wide," he
wrote;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and he declared to Randolph that "if these
self-created societies cannot be discountenanced,
they will destroy the government of this country."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Conservative apprehensions were thus voiced by
George Cabot: "We have seen ... the ... representatives
of the people butchered, and a band of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
relentless murderers ruling in their stead with rods
of iron. Will not this, or something like it, be the
wretched fate of our country?... Is not this hostility
and distrust [to just opinions and right sentiments]
chiefly produced by the slanders and falsehoods
which the anarchists incessantly inculcate?"<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Young men like John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts
and John Marshall of Virginia thought that
"the rabble that followed on the heels of Jack Cade
could not have devised greater absurdities than"
the French Revolution had inspired in America;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
but they were greatly outnumbered by those for
whom Jefferson spoke when he said that "I feel that
the permanence of our own [Government] leans" on
the success of the French Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The American democratic societies, like their
French originals, declared that theirs was the voice
of "the people," and popular clamor justified the
claim.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Everybody who dissented from the edicts
of the clubs was denounced as a public robber or
monarchist. "What a continual yelping and barking
are our Swindlers, Aristocrats, Refugees, and British
Agents making at the Constitutional Societies"
which were "like a noble mastiff ... with ... impotent
and noisy puppies at his heels," cried the
indignant editor of the "Independent Chronicle"
of Boston,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> to whom the democratic societies were
"guardians of liberty."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>While these organizations strengthened radical
opinion and fashioned American sympathizers of the
French Revolution into disciplined ranks, they also
solidified the conservative elements of the United
States. Most viciously did the latter hate these
"Jacobin Clubs," the principles they advocated,
and their interference with public affairs. "They
were born in sin, the impure offspring of Gen&ecirc;t,"
wrote Fisher Ames.</p>

<p>"They are the few against the many; the sons of
darkness (for their meetings are secret) against those
of the light; and above all, it is a <i>town</i> cabal, attempting
to rule the <i>country</i>."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> This testy New
Englander thus expressed the extreme conservative
feeling against the "insanity which is epidemic":<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
"This French mania," said Ames, "is the bane of
our politics, the mortal poison that makes our peace
so sickly."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> "They have, like toads, sucked poison
from the earth. They thirst for vengeance."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> "The
spirit of mischief is as active as the element of fire
and as destructive."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Ames describes the activities
of the Boston Society and the aversion of the "better
classes" for it: "The club is despised here by men of
right heads," he writes. "But ... they [the members
of the Club] poison every spring; they whisper lies
to every gale; they are everywhere, always acting like
Old Nick and his imps.... They will be as busy as
Macbeth's witches at the election."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>In Virginia the French Revolution and the American
"Jacobins" helped to effect that change in
Patrick Henry's political sentiments which his increasing
wealth had begun. "If my Country,"
wrote Henry to Washington, "is destined in my
day to encounter the horrors of anarchy, every
power of mind or body which I possess will be exerted
in support of the government under which I
live."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> As to France itself, Henry predicted that
"anarchy will be succeeded by despotism" and
Bonaparte, "Caesar-like, subvert the liberties of his
country."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Marshall was as much opposed to the democratic
societies as was Washington, or Cabot, or Ames, but
he was calmer in his opposition, although vitriolic
enough. When writing even ten years later, after
time had restored perspective and cooled feeling,
Marshall says that these "pernicious societies"<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
were "the resolute champions of all the encroachments
attempted by the agents of the French republic
on the government of the United States, and
the steady defamers of the views and measures of
the American executive."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> He thus describes their
decline:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The colossean power of the [French] clubs, which
had been abused to an excess that gives to faithful
history the appearance of fiction, fell with that of
their favourite member, and they sunk into long
merited disgrace. The means by which their political
influence had been maintained were wrested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
from them; and, in a short time, their meetings were
prohibited. Not more certain is it that the boldest
streams must disappear, if the fountains which fed
them be emptied, than was the dissolution of the
democratic societies of America, when the Jacobin
clubs were denounced by France. As if their destinies
depended on the same thread, the political death of
the former was the unerring signal for that of the
latter."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Such was the effect of the French Revolution on
American thought at the critical period of our new
Government's first trials. To measure justly the
speech and conduct of men during the years we are
now to review, this influence must always be borne
in mind. It was woven into every great issue that
arose in the United States. Generally speaking, the
debtor classes and the poorer people were partisans
of French revolutionary principles; and the creditor
classes, the mercantile and financial interests, were
the enemies of what they called "Jacobin philosophy."
In a broad sense, those who opposed taxes,
levied to support a strong National Government,
sympathized with the French Revolution and believed
in its ideas; those who advocated taxes for
that purpose, abhorred that convulsion and feared
its doctrines.</p>

<p>Those who had disliked government before the
Constitution was established and who now hated National
control, heard in the preachings of the French
revolutionary theorists the voice of their hearts;
while those who believed that government is essen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>tial
to society and absolutely indispensable to the
building of the American Nation, heard in the language
and saw in the deeds of the French Revolution
the forces that would wreck the foundations of
the state even while they were but being laid and,
in the end, dissolve society itself. Thus were the
ideas of Nationality and localism in America brought
into sharper conflict by the mob and guillotine in
France.</p>

<p>All the passion for irresponsible liberty which the
French Revolution increased in America, as well as
all the resentment aroused by the financial measures
and foreign policy of the "Federal Administrations,"
were combined in the opposition to and attacks
upon a strong National Government. Thus provincialism
in the form of States' Rights was given a
fresh impulse and a new vitality. Through nearly
all the important legislation and diplomacy of those
stirring and interpretative years ran, with ever increasing
clearness, the dividing line of Nationalism
as against localism.</p>

<p>Such are the curious turns of human history.
Those whom Jefferson led profoundly believed that
they were fighting for human rights; and in their
view and as a practical matter at that particular
time this sacred cause meant State Rights. For
everything which they felt to be oppressive, unjust,
and antagonistic to liberty, came from the National
Government. By natural contrast in their own
minds, as well as by assertions of their leaders, the
State Governments were the sources of justice and
the protectors of the genuine rights of man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>In the development of John Marshall as well as of
his great ultimate antagonist, Thomas Jefferson, during
the formative decade which we are now to consider,
the influence of the French Revolution must
never be forgotten. Not a circumstance of the public
lives of these two men and scarcely an incident of
their private experience but was shaped and colored
by this vast series of human events. Bearing in mind
the influence of the French Revolution on American
opinion, and hence, on Marshall and Jefferson, let
us examine the succeeding years in the light of this
determining fact.</p>

216. Lafayette's letters to Washington, from the beginning of the
French Revolution down to his humiliating expulsion from France,
constitute a thermometer of French temperature, all the more trustworthy
because his letters are so na&iuml;ve. For example, in March,
1790: "Our revolution is getting on as well as it can, with a nation that
has swallowed liberty at once, and is still liable to mistake licentiousness
for freedom." Or, in August of the same year: "I have lately lost
some of my favor with the mob, and displeased the frantic lovers of
licentiousness, as I am bent on establishing a legal subordination."
Or, six months later: "I still am tossed about in the ocean of factions
and commotions of every kind." Or, two months afterwards: "There
appears a kind of phenomenon in my situation; all parties against
me, and a national popularity which, in spite of every effort, has
been unshakable." (Lafayette to Washington, March 17, 1790; <i>ib.</i>,
321; Aug. 28, <i>ib.</i>, 345; March 7, 1791, <i>ib.</i>, 361; May 3, 1791, <i>ib.</i>, 372.)</p></div>

the Bastille generally found themselves very well off indeed. The
records of this celebrated prison show that even prisoners of mean
station, when incarcerated for so grave a crime as conspiracy against
the King's life, had, in addition to remarkably abundant meals, an
astonishing amount of extra viands and refreshments including comfortable
quantities of wine, brandy, and beer. Prisoners of higher
station fared still more generously, of course. (Funck-Brentano:
<i>Legends of the Bastille</i>, 85-113; see also <i>ib.</i>, introduction.) It should be
said, however, that the <i>lettres de cachet</i> were a chief cause of complaint,
although the stories, generally exaggerated, concerning the cruel
treatment of prisoners came to be the principal count of the public
indictment of the Bastille.</p></div>

Jefferson wrote Washington and the elder Adams, trying to evade his
patronage of Paine's pamphlet; but, as Mr. Ford moderately remarks,
"the explanation was somewhat lame." (<i>Writings, J. Q. A.</i>: Ford, i,
65; and see Hazen, 156-57.) Later Jefferson avowed that "Mr.
Paine's principles ... were the principles of the citizens of the U. S."
(Jefferson to Adams, Aug. 30, 1791; <i>Works</i>: Ford, vi, 314.) To his
intimate friend, Monroe, Jefferson wrote that "Publicola, in attacking
all Paine's principles, is very desirous of involving me in the same
censure with the author. I certainly merit the same, for I profess the
same principles." (Jefferson to Monroe, July 10, 1791; <i>ib.</i>, 280.)

Jefferson at this time was just on the threshold of his discovery

1792: "Those mad &amp; corrupted people in France who under the name
of liberty have destroyed their own government [French Constitution
of 1791] &amp; disgusted all ... men of honesty &amp; property.... All the
rights of humanity ... are daily violated with impunity ... universal
anarchy prevails.... There is no succour ... against mobs &amp;
factions which have assumed despotic power."
</p><p>
July 31: "The factions which have lately determined the system ...
for violating all the bonds of civil society ... have disgusted all,
except the <i>sans culottes</i> ... with the present order of things ... the
most perfect &amp; universal disorder that ever reigned in any country.
Those who from the beginning took part in the revolution ... have
been disgusted, by the follies, injustice, &amp; atrocities of the Jacobins....
All power [is] in the hands of the most mad, wicked &amp; atrocious
assembly that ever was collected in any country."
</p><p>
August 15: "The Swiss guards have been massacred by the people
&amp; ... streets literally are red with blood."
</p><p>
October 12: "Their [French] successes abroad are unquestionably
evils for humanity. The spirit which they will propagate is so destructive
of all order ... so subversive of all ideas of justice&mdash;the system
they aim at so absolutely visionary &amp; impracticable&mdash;that their
efforts can end in nothing but despotism after having bewildered the
unfortunate people, whom they render free in their way, in violence
&amp; crimes, &amp; wearied them with sacrifices of blood, which alone they
consider worthy of the furies whom they worship under the names
of <i>Libert&eacute;</i> &amp; <i>Egalit&eacute;</i>!"
</p><p>
August 24: "I sh<sup>d&#803;</sup> not be at all surprized to hear of the present
leaders being hung by the people. Such has been the moral of this
revolution from the beginning. The people have gone farther than
their leaders.... We may expect ... to hear of such proceedings, under
the cloak of liberty, <i>&eacute;galit&eacute;</i> &amp; patriotism as would disgrace any
<i>chambre ardente</i> that has ever created in humanity shudders at the
idea." (Short MSS., Lib. Cong.)
</p><p>
These are examples of the statements to which Jefferson's letter,
quoted in the text following, was the reply. Short's most valuable letters
are from The Hague, to which he had been transferred. They are
all the more important, as coming from a young radical whom events
in France had changed into a conservative. And Jefferson's letter
is conclusive of American popular sentiment, which he seldom
opposed.</p></div>

Short had written Jefferson that Morris, then in Paris, would inform
him of French conditions. Morris had done so. For instance,
he wrote officially to Jefferson, nearly four months before the latter's
letter to Short quoted in the text, that: "We have had one
week of unchecked murders, in which some thousands have perished
in this city [Paris]. It began with between two and three hundred
of the clergy, who would not take the oath prescribed by law. Thence
these <i>executors of speedy justice</i> went to the Abbaye, where the prisoners
were confined who were at Court on the 10th. Madame de
Lamballe ... was beheaded and disembowelled; the head and entrails
paraded on pikes through the street, and the body dragged
after them," etc., etc. (Morris to Jefferson, Sept. 10, 1792; Morris,

his statements of fact are generally trustworthy. "I have seen a

to prevail which puts the sceptre of Sovereignty in the hands of

<h3>A VIRGINIA NATIONALIST</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Lace Congress up straitly within the enumerated powers. (Jefferson.)</p>

<p>Construe the constitution liberally in advancement of the common good.
(Hamilton.)</p>

<p>To organize government, to retrieve the national character, to establish a
system of revenue, to create public credit, were among the duties imposed
upon them. (Marshall.)</p>

<p>I trust in that Providence which has saved us in six troubles, yea, in seven,
to rescue us again. (Washington.)</p></div>


<p>The Constitution's narrow escape from defeat in
the State Conventions did not end the struggle
against the National principle that pervaded it.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The
Anti-Nationalists put forth all their strength to send
to the State Legislatures and to the National House
and Senate as many antagonists of the National
idea as possible.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> "Exertions will be made to engage
two thirds of the legislatures in the task of
regularly undermining the government" was Madison's
"hint" to Hamilton.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Madison cautioned Washington to the same effect,
suggesting that a still more ominous part of
the plan was "to get a Congress appointed in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>first instance that will commit suicide on their own
Authority."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Not yet had the timorous Madison
personally felt the burly hand of the sovereign people
so soon to fall upon him. Not yet had he undergone
that familiar reversal of principles wrought
in those politicians who keep an ear to the ground.
But that change was swiftly approaching. Even
then the <i>vox populi</i> was filling the political heavens
with a clamor not to be denied by the ambitious.
The sentiment of the people required only an organizer
to become formidable and finally omnipotent.</p>

<p>Such an artisan of public opinion was soon to appear.
Indeed, the master political potter was even
then about to start for America where the clay for
an Anti-Nationalist Party was almost kneaded for
the moulder's hands. Jefferson was preparing to leave
France; and not many months later the great politician
landed on his native soil and among his fellow
citizens, who, however, welcomed him none too
ardently.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>No one knew just where Jefferson stood on the fundamental
question of the hour when, with his two
daughters, he arrived in Virginia in 1789. The brilliant
Virginian had uttered both Nationalist and
Anti-Nationalist sentiments. "I am not of the party
of the Federalists," he protested, "but I am much
farther from that of the Antifederalists." Indeed,
declared Jefferson, "If I could not go to heaven but
with a party, I would not go there at all."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>His first opinions of the Constitution were, as we
have seen, unfavorable. But after he had learned
that the new Government was to be a fact, Jefferson
wrote Washington: "I have seen with infinite pleasure
our new constitution accepted." Careful study
had taught him, he said, "that circumstances may
arise, and probably will arise, wherein all the resources
of taxation will be necessary for the safety
of the state." He saw probability of war which "requires
every resource of taxation &amp; credit." He
thought that "the power of making war often prevents
it."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Thus Jefferson could be quoted on both sides and
claimed by neither or by both. But, because of his
absence in France and of the reports he had received
from the then extreme Nationalist, Madison, he had
not yet apprehended the people's animosity to National
rule. Upon his arrival in Virginia, however,
he discovered that "Antifederalism is not yet dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
in this country."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> That much, indeed, was clear at
first sight. The Legislature of Virginia, which met
three months after her Convention had ratified the
Constitution, was determined to undo that work, as
Madison had foreseen.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i001.jpg" width="480" height="618" alt="John Marshall by E. F. Petticolas" title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>John Marshall<br />
<small>From a painting by E. F. Petticolas</small></i></span>
</div>

<p>That body was militantly against the new Government
as it stood. "The conflict between the powers
of the general and state governments was coeval
with those governments," declares Marshall. "The
old line of division was still as strongly marked as
ever." The enemies of National power thought that
"liberty could be endangered only by encroachments
upon the states; and that it was the great duty of
patriotism to restrain the powers of the general government
within the narrowest possible limits." On
the other hand, the Nationalists, says Marshall,
"sincerely believed that the real danger which
threatened the republic was to be looked for in the
undue ascendency of the states."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Patrick Henry was supreme in the House of Delegates.
Washington was vastly concerned at the
prospect. He feared that the enemies of Nationalism
would control the State Legislature and that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>it would respond to New York's appeal for a new
Federal Constitutional Convention. He was "particularly
alarmed" that the General Assembly
would elect Senators "entirely anti-Federal."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> His
apprehension was justified. Hardly a week passed
after the House convened until it passed resolutions,
drawn by Henry,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> to answer Clinton's letter,
to ask Congress to call a new Federal Convention,
and to co&ouml;perate with other States in that
business.</p>

<p>In vain did the Nationalist members strive to
soften this resolution. An amendment which went
so far as to request Congress to recommend to the
several States "the ratification of a bill of rights"
and of the twenty amendments proposed by the Virginia
Convention, was defeated by a majority of
46 out of a total vote of 124.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Swiftly and without
mercy the triumphant opposition struck its next
blow. Washington had urged Madison to stand for
the Senate,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and the Nationalists exerted themselves
to elect him. Madison wrote cleverly in his own
behalf.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> But he had no hope of success because it
was "certain that a clear majority of the assembly
are enemies to the Gov<sup>t&#803;</sup>."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Madison was still the
ultra-Nationalist, who, five years earlier, had wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the National Government to have an absolute veto
on <i>every</i> State law.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Henry delivered "a tremendous philippic" against
Madison as soon as his name was placed before the
General Assembly.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Madison was badly beaten, and
Richard Henry Lee and William Grayson were
chosen as the first Senators from Virginia under the
new National Government.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The defeated champion
of the Constitution attributed Henry's attack and
his own misfortune to his Nationalist principles:
Henry's "enmity was levelled ... ag<sup>st</sup> the <i>whole
system</i>; and the destruction of the whole system, I
take to be the secret wish of his heart."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>In such fashion did Madison receive his first
chastisement for his Nationalist views and labors.
He required no further discipline of a kind so rough
and humiliating; and he sought and secured election
to the National House of Representatives,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> with
opinions much subdued and his whole being made
pliant for the wizard who so soon was to invoke his
spell over that master mind.</p>

<p>Though Marshall was not in the Virginia Legislature
at that session, it is certain that he worked
with its members for Madison's election as Senator.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
But even Marshall's persuasiveness was unavailing.
"Nothing," wrote Randolph to Madison, "is left undone
which can tend to the subversion of the new
government."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Hard upon its defeat of Madison the Legislature
adopted an ominous address to Congress. "The
sooner ... the [National] government is possessed of
the confidence of the people ... <i>the longer its duration</i>"&mdash;such
was the language and spirit of Virginia's
message to the lawmakers of the Nation,
even before they had assembled.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The desperate
Nationalists sought to break the force of this blow.
They proposed a substitute which even suggested
that the widely demanded new Federal Convention
should be called by Congress if that body thought
best. But all to no purpose. Their solemn<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> amendment
was beaten by a majority of 22 out of a total
vote of 122.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Thus again was displayed that hostility to Nationalism
which was to focus upon the newborn National
Government every burning ray of discontent
from the flames that sprang up all over the country
during the constructive but riotous years that followed.
Were the people taxed to pay obligations
incurred in our War for Independence?&mdash;the Na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>tional
Government was to blame. Was an excise
laid on whiskey, "the common drink of the nation"<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>&mdash;it
was the National Government which thus
wrung tribute from the universal thirst. Were those
who owed debts compelled, at last, to pay them?&mdash;it
was the National Government which armed the
creditor with power to recover his own.</p>

<p>Why did we not aid French Republicans against
the hordes of "despotism"? Because the National
Government, with its accursed Neutrality, would not
let us! And who but the National Government would
dare make a treaty with British Monarchy, sacrificing
American rights? Speculation and corruption,
parade and ostentation,&mdash;everything that could,
reasonably or unreasonably, be complained of,&mdash;were,
avowed the Anti-Nationalists, the wretched
but legitimate offspring of Nationalism. The remedy,
of course, was to weaken the power of the Nation
and strengthen that of the States. Such was
the course pursued by the foes of Nationalism, that
we shall trace during the first three administrations
of the Government of the United States.</p>

<p>Thus, the events that took place between 1790 and
1800, supplemented and heated by the French Revolution,
developed to their full stature those antagonistic
theories of which John Marshall and Thomas
Jefferson were to become the chief expounders.
Those events also finished the preparation of these
two men for the commanding stations they were to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
occupy. The radical politician and States' Rights
leader on the one hand, and the conservative politician
and Nationalist jurist on the other hand, were
finally settled in their opinions during these developing
years, at the end of which one of them was to
occupy the highest executive office and the other
the highest judicial office in the Government.</p>

<p>It was under such circumstances that the National
Government, with Washington at its head, began its
uncertain career. If the Legislature of Virginia had
gone so far before the infant National establishment
was under way, how far might not succeeding Legislatures
go? No one knew. But it was plain to all
that every act of the new Administration, even with
Washington at the helm, would be watched with
keen and jealous eyes; and that each Nationalist
turn of the wheel would meet with prompt and stern
resistance in the General Assembly of the greatest
of American Commonwealths. Mutiny was already
aboard.</p>

<p>John Marshall, therefore, determined again to
seek election to the House of Delegates.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the organization of the National
Government, Washington appointed Marshall
to be United States Attorney for the District
of Virginia. The young lawyer's friends had suggested
his name to the President, intimating that he
wished the place.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Marshall, high in the esteem of
every one, had been consulted as to appointments on
the National bench,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and Washington gladly named<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
him for District Attorney. But when notified of his
appointment, Marshall declined the honor.</p>

<p>A seat in the Virginia Legislature, was, however,
quite another matter. Although his work as a legislator
would interfere with his profession much
more than would his duties as United States Attorney,
he could be of practical service to the
National Government in the General Assembly of
the State where, it was plain, the first battle for
Nationalism must be fought.</p>

<p>The Virginia Nationalists, much alarmed, urged
him to make the race. The most popular man in
Richmond, he was the only Nationalist who could
be elected by that constituency; and, if chosen,
would be the ablest supporter of the Administration
in the Legislature. Although the people of Henrico
County were more strongly against a powerful National
Government than they had been when they
sent Marshall to the Constitutional Convention the
previous year, they nevertheless elected him; and in
1789 Marshall once more took his seat as a member
of Virginia's law-making and law-marring body.</p>

<p>He was at once given his old place on the two principal
standing committees;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and on special committees
to bring in various bills,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> among them one concerning
descents, a difficult subject and of particular

<p>The irrepressible subject of paying taxes in something
else than money soon came up. Marshall voted
against a proposition to pay the taxes in hemp and
tobacco, which was defeated by a majority of 37
out of a total vote of 139; and he voted for the resolution
"that the taxes of the present year ought to
be paid in specie only or in warrants equivalent
thereto," which carried.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> He was added to the committee

<p>Marshall was, of course, appointed on the special
committee to bring in a bill giving statehood to the
District of Kentucky.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Thus he had to do with the
creation of the second State to be admitted after
the Constitution was adopted. A bill was passed

<p>Marshall was appointed on the committee to
bring in bills for proceeding against absent debtors;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
on another to amend the penal code;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and he was
made chairman of the special committee to examine
the James River Company,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> of which he was a stock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>holder.
Such are examples of his routine activities
in the Legislature of 1789.</p>

<p>The Legislature instructed the Virginia Senators
in Congress "to use their utmost endeavors to procure
the admission of the citizens of the United
States to hear the debates of their House, whenever
they are sitting in their legislative capacity."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>An address glowing with love, confidence, and
veneration was sent to Washington.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Then Jefferson
came to Richmond; and the Legislature appointed
a committee to greet him with polite but coldly formal
congratulations.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> No one then foresaw that a
few short years would turn the reverence and affection
for Washington into disrespect and hostility,
and the indifference toward Jefferson into fiery
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The first skirmish in the engagement between the
friends and foes of a stronger National Government
soon came on. On November 30, 1789, the House
ratified the first twelve amendments to the Constitution,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
which the new Congress had submitted
to the States; but three days later it was proposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
that the Legislature urge Congress to reconsider the
amendments recommended by Virginia which Congress
had not adopted.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> An attempt to make this
resolution stronger was defeated by the deciding
vote of the Speaker, Marshall voting against it.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The Anti-Nationalist State Senate refused to concur
in the House's ratification of the amendments
proposed by Congress;<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and Marshall was one of
the committee to hold a conference with the Senate
committee on the subject.</p>

<p>After Congress had passed the laws necessary to
set the National Government in motion, Madison
had reluctantly offered his summary of the volume
of amendments to the Constitution recommended
by the States "in order," as he said, "to quiet that
anxiety which prevails in the public mind."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The
debate is illuminating. The amendments, as agreed
to, fell far short of the radical and extensive alterations
which the States had asked and were understood
to be palliatives to popular discontent.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Randolph in Richmond wrote that the amendments
were "much approved by the <i>strong</i> federalists ... being considered as an anodyne to the discontented.
Some others ... expect to hear, ... that
a real amelioration of the Constitution was not so
much intended, as a soporific draught to the restless.
I believe, indeed," declared Randolph, "that
nothing&mdash;nay, not even the abolishment of direct
taxation&mdash;would satisfy those who are most clamorous."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The amendments were used by many, who changed
from advocates to opponents of broad National powers,
as a pretext for reversed views and conduct; but
such as were actually adopted were not a sufficient
justification for their action.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The great question, however, with which the First
Congress had to deal, was the vexed and vital problem
of finance. It was the heart of the whole constitutional
movement.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Without a solution of it the
National Government was, at best, a doubtful experiment.
The public debt was a chaos of variegated
obligations, including the foreign and domestic debts
contracted by the Confederation, the debts of the
various States, the heavy accumulation of interest on
all.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Public and private credit, which had risen when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the Constitution finally became an accomplished
fact, was now declining with capital's frail timidity
of the uncertain.</p>

<p>In his "First Report on the Public Credit," Hamilton
showed the way out of this maddening jungle.
Pay the foreign debt, said Hamilton, assume as a
National obligation the debts of the States and
fund them, together with those of the Confederation.
All had been contracted for a common purpose in a
common cause; all were "the price of liberty." Let
the owners of certificates, both State and Continental,
be paid in full with arrears of interest, without
discrimination between original holders and
those who had purchased from them. And let this
be done by exchanging for the old certificates those
of the new National Government bearing interest
and transferable. These latter then would pass as
specie;<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> the country would be supplied with a great
volume of sound money, so badly needed,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and the
debt be in the process of extinguishment.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Hamilton's entire financial system was assailed
with fury both in Congress and among the people.
The funding plan, said its opponents, was a stock-jobbing
scheme, the bank a speculator's contrivance,
the National Assumption of State debts a dishonest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
trick. The whole was a plot designed to array the
moneyed interests in support of the National Government.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Assumption of State debts was a device
to increase the National power and influence and to
lessen still more the strength and importance of the
States.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The speculators, who had bought the depreciated
certificates of the needy, would be enriched
from the substance of the whole people.</p>

<p>Without avail had Hamilton answered every objection
in advance; the careful explanations in Congress
of his financial measures went for naught; the
materials for popular agitation against the National
Government were too precious to be neglected by its
foes.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> "The first regular and systematic opposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to the principles on which the affairs of the union
were administered," writes Marshall, "originated in
the measures which were founded on it [the "First
Report on the Public Credit"]."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>The Assumption of State debts was the strategic
point of attack, especially for the Virginia politicians;
and upon Assumption, therefore, they wisely concentrated
their forces. Nor were they without
plausible ground of opposition; for Virginia, having
given as much to the common cause as any State
and more than most of her sisters, and having suffered
greatly, had by the sale of her public lands
paid off more of her debt than had any of the rest
of them.</p>

<p>It seemed, therefore, unjust to Virginians to put
their State on a parity with those Commonwealths
who had been less prompt. On the other hand, the
certificates of debt, State and Continental, had accumulated
in the North and East;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and these sections
were determined that the debt should be assumed by
the Nation.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> So the debate in Congress was heated
and prolonged, the decision doubtful. On various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
amendments, sometimes one side and sometimes
the other prevailed, often by a single vote.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>At the same time the question of the permanent
location of the National Capital arose.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> On these
two subjects Congress was deadlocked. Both were
disposed of finally by the famous deal between Jefferson
and Hamilton, by which the latter agreed
to get enough votes to establish the Capital on the
Potomac and the former enough votes to pass the
Assumption Bill.</p>

<p>Washington had made Jefferson his Secretary of
State purely on merit. For similar reasons of efficiency
Hamilton had been appointed Secretary of the
Treasury, after Robert Morris, Washington's first
choice, had declined that office.</p>

<p>At Jefferson's dinner table, the two Secretaries
discussed the predicament and made the bargain.
Thereupon, Jefferson, with all the zeal of his ardent
temperament, threw himself into the contest to pass
Hamilton's financial measure; and not only secured
the necessary votes to make Assumption a law, but
wrote letters broadcast in support of it.</p>

<p>"Congress has been long embarrassed," he advised
Monroe, "by two of the most irritating questions
that ever can be raised, ... the funding the
public debt and ... the fixing on a more central
residence.... Unless they can be reconciled by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
some plan of compromise, there will be no funding
bill agreed to, our credit ... will burst and vanish
and the states separate to take care every one of
itself." Jefferson outlines the bargain for fixing the
Capital and assuming the debts, and concludes:
"If this plan of compromise does not take place,
I fear one infinitely worse."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> To John Harvie he
writes: "With respect to Virginia the measure is ... divested
of ... injustice."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson delivered three Southern votes to pass
the bill for Assumption of the State debts, and
Hamilton got enough Northern votes to locate the
National Capital permanently where it now stands.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
Thus this vital part of Hamilton's comprehensive
financial plan was squeezed through Congress by
only two votes.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> But Virginia was not appeased and
remained the center of the opposition.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Business at once improved. "The sudden increase
of monied capital," writes Marshall, "invigorated
commerce, and gave a new stimulus to agriculture."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
But the "immense wealth which individuals acquired"
by the instantaneous rise in the value of the
certificates of debt caused popular jealousy and discontent.
The debt was looked upon, not as the funding
of obligations incurred in our War for Independence,
but as a scheme newly hatched to strengthen
the National Government by "the creation of a
monied interest ... subservient to its will."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>The Virginia Legislature, of which Marshall was
now the foremost Nationalist member, convened
soon after Assumption had become a National law.
A smashing resolution, drawn by Henry,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> was proposed,
asserting that Assumption "is repugnant to
the constitution of the United States, as it goes
to the exercise of a power not expressly granted
to the general government."<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Marshall was active
among and, indeed, led those who resisted to the
uttermost the attack upon this thoroughly National
measure of the National Government.</p>

<p>Knowing that they were outnumbered in the
Legislature and that the people were against Assumption,
Marshall and his fellow Nationalists in
the House of Delegates employed the expedient of
compromise. They proposed to amend Henry's resolution
by stating that Assumption would place on
Virginia a "heavy debt ... which never can be extinguished"
so long as the debt of any other State
remained unpaid; that it was "inconsistent with
justice"; that it would "alienate the affections of
good citizens of this Commonwealth from the gov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>ernment
of the United States ... and finally tend
to produce measures extremely unfavorable to the
interests of the Union."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Savage enough for any one, it would seem, was this
amendment of the Nationalists in the Virginia
Legislature; but its fangs were not sufficiently poisonous
to suit the opposition. It lacked, particularly,
the supreme virtue of asserting the law's unconstitutionality.
So the Virginia Anti-Nationalists rejected
it by a majority of 41 votes out of a total of 135.</p>

<p>Marshall and his determined band of Nationalists
labored hard to retrieve this crushing defeat.
On Henry's original resolution, they slightly increased
their strength, but were again beaten by a
majority of 23 out of 127 voting.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the triumphant opposition reported a
protest and remonstrance to Congress. This brilliant
Anti-Nationalist State paper&mdash;the Magna Charta
of States' Rights&mdash;sounded the first formal call to
arms for the doctrine that all powers not expressly
given in the Constitution were reserved to the States.
It also impeached the Assumption Act as an effort
"to erect and concentrate and perpetuate a large
monied interest in opposition to the landed interests,"
which would prostrate "agriculture at the
feet of commerce" or result in a "change in the
present form of Federal Government, fatal to the
existence of American liberty."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>But the unconstitutionality of Assumption was
the main objection. The memorial declared that
"during the whole discussion of the federal consti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>tution
by the convention of Virginia, your memorialists
were taught to believe 'that every power not
expressly granted was retained' ... and upon this
positive condition" the Constitution had been
adopted. But where could anything be found in the
Constitution "authorizing Congress to express terms
or to assume the debts of the states?" Nowhere!
Therefore, Congress had no such power.</p>

<p>"As the guardians, then, of the rights and interests
of their constituents; as sentinels placed by them
over the ministers of the Federal Government, to
shield it from their encroachments," the Anti-Nationalists
in the Virginia Legislature sounded the
alarm.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> It was of this jealous temper of the States
that Ames so accurately wrote a year later: "The
[National] government is too far off to gain the affections
of the people.... Instead of feeling as a Nation,
a State is our country. We look with indifference,
often with hatred, fear, and aversion, to the
other states."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Marshall and his fellow Nationalists strove earnestly
to extract from the memorial as much venom
as possible, but were able to get only three or four
lines left out;<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and the report was adopted practically
as originally drafted.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Thus Marshall was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the first skirmish, after the National Government
had been established, of that constitutional engagement
in which, ultimately, Nationalism was to
be challenged on the field of battle. Sumter and
Appomattox were just below the horizon.</p>

<p>The remainder of Hamilton's financial plan was
speedily placed upon the statute books of the Republic,
though not without determined resistance
which, more and more, took on a grim and ugly
aspect both in Congress and throughout the country.</p>

<p>When Henry's resolution, on which the Virginia
remonstrance was based, reached Hamilton, he instantly
saw its logical result. It was, he thought, the
major premise of the syllogism of National disintegration.
"This," exclaimed Hamilton, of the Virginia
resolution, "is the first symptom of a spirit which
must either be killed or it will kill the Constitution
of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>The Anti-Nationalist memorial of the Legislature
of Virginia accurately expressed the sentiment of the
State. John Taylor of Caroline two years later, in
pamphlets of marked ability, attacked the Administration's
entire financial system and its management.
While he exhaustively analyzed its economic features,
yet he traced all its supposed evils to the Nationalist
idea. The purpose and result of Hamilton's
whole plan and of the manner of its execution was,
declared Taylor, to "Swallow up ... the once sovereign ... states....
Hence all assumptions and ... the
enormous loans." Thus "the state governments
will become only speculative commonwealths
to be read for amusement, like Harrington's <i>Oceana</i>
or Moore's <i>Utopia</i>."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The fight apparently over, Marshall declined to
become a candidate for the Legislature in the following
year. The Administration's financial plan was
now enacted into law and the vital part of the National
machinery thus set up and in motion. The
country was responding with a degree of prosperity
hitherto unknown, and, for the time, all seemed
secure.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> So Marshall did not again consent to serve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
in the House of Delegates until 1795. But the years
between these periods of his public life brought forth
events which were determinative of the Nation's
future. Upon the questions growing out of them,
John Marshall was one of the ever-decreasing Virginia
minority which stanchly upheld the policies
of the National Government.</p>

<p>Virginia's declaration of the unconstitutionality of
the Assumption Act had now thundered in Jefferson's
ears. He himself was instrumental in the enactment
of this law and its unconstitutionality never
occurred to him<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> until Virginia spoke. But, faithful
to the people's voice,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Jefferson was already publicly
opposing, through the timid but resourceful
Madison<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and the fearless and aggressive<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Giles,
the Nationalist statesmanship of Hamilton.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it came about that when Washington asked
his Cabinet's opinion upon the bill to incorporate the
Bank of the United States, Jefferson promptly expressed
with all his power the constitutional theory
of the Virginia Legislature. The opposition had
reached the point when, if no other objection could
be found to any measure of the National Government,
its "unconstitutionality" was urged against
it. "We hear, incessantly, from the old foes of the
Constitution 'this is unconstitutional and that is,'
and, indeed, what is not? I scarce know a point
which has not produced this cry, not excepting a
motion for adjourning."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Jefferson now proceeded
"to produce this cry" against the Bank Bill.</p>

<p>Hamilton's plan, said Jefferson, violated the Constitution.
"To take a single step beyond the
boundaries thus specially drawn around the powers
of Congress [the Twelfth Amendment]<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> is to take
possession of a boundless field of power, no longer
susceptible of any definition." Even if the bank were
"convenient" to carry out any power specifically
granted in the Constitution, yet it was not "<i>necessary</i>,"
argued Jefferson; all powers expressly given
could be exercised without the bank. It was only indispensable
powers that the Constitution permitted
to be implied from those definitely bestowed on
Congress&mdash;"convenience is not necessity."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Hamilton answered with his argument for the
doctrine of implied powers.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Banks, said he, are
products of civilized life&mdash;all enlightened commercial
nations have them. He showed the benefits
and utility of banks; answered all the objections
to these financial agencies; and then examined the
disputed constitutionality of the bill for the incorporation
of the Bank of the United States.</p>

<p>All the powers of the National Government were
not set down in words in the Constitution and could
not be. For instance, there are the "resulting
powers," as over conquered territory. Nobody could
deny the existence of such powers&mdash;yet they were
not granted by the language of the fundamental law.
As to Jefferson's argument based on the word "necessary,"
his contention meant, said Hamilton, that
"no means are to be considered <i>necessary</i> without
which the power would be <i>nugatory</i>"&mdash;which was
absurd. Jefferson's reasoning would require that an
implied power should be "<i>absolutely</i> or <i>indispensably</i>
necessary."</p>

<p>But this was not the ordinary meaning of the
word and it was by this usual and customary understanding
of terms that the Constitution must be
interpreted. If Jefferson was right, Congress could
act only in "a case of extreme necessity." Such a
construction of the Constitution would prevent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the National Government even from erecting lighthouses,
piers, and other conveniences of commerce
which <i>could</i> be carried on without them. These
illustrations revealed the paralysis of government
concealed in Jefferson's philosophy.</p>

<p>The true test of implied powers, Hamilton showed,
was the "natural relation [of means] to the ... lawful
ends of the government." Collection of taxes,
foreign and interstate trade, were, admittedly, such
ends. The National power to "<i>regulate</i>" these is
"<i>sovereign</i>"; and therefore "to employ all the means
which will relate to their regulation to the best and
greatest advantage" is permissible.</p>

<p>"This <i>general principle</i> is <i>inherent</i> in the very
<i>definition</i> of government," declared he, "and <i>essential</i>
to every step of the progress to be made by that
of the United States, namely: That every power
vested in a government is in its nature <i>sovereign</i> and
included by <i>force</i> of the <i>term</i>, a right to employ all
the <i>means</i> requisite and fairly applicable to the
attainment of the <i>ends</i> of such power, and which are
not precluded by restrictions and exceptions specified
in the Constitution or not immoral, or not contrary
to the <i>essential</i> ends of political society....</p>

<p>"The powers of the Federal Government, as to
<i>its objects</i> are sovereign"; the National Constitution,
National laws, and treaties are expressly
declared to be "the supreme law of the land."
And he added, sarcastically: "The power which
can create <i>the supreme law of the land</i> in <i>any case</i>
is doubtless <i>sovereign</i> as to such case." But, said
Hamilton, "it is unquestionably incident to <i>sove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>reign power</i>
to erect corporations, and consequently
to <i>that</i> of the United States, in <i>relation</i> to the <i>objects</i>
intrusted to the management of the government."</p>

<p>And, finally: "The powers contained in a constitution
of government ... ought to be construed
liberally in advancement of the public good.... The
means by which natural exigencies are to be provided
for, national inconveniences obviated, national prosperity
promoted are of such infinite variety, extent,
and complexity, that there must of necessity be
great latitude of discretion in the selection and application
of those means."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>So were stated the opposing principles of liberal
and narrow interpretation of the Constitution, about
which were gathering those political parties that,
says Marshall, "in their long and dubious conflict ... have shaken the United States to their centre."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
The latter of these parties, under the name "Republican,"
was then being shaped into a compact
organization. Its strength was increasing. The object
of Republican attack was the National Government;
that of Republican praise and affection
was the sovereignty of the States.</p>

<p>"The hatred of the Jacobites towards the house
of Hanover was never more deadly than that ...
borne by many of the partisans of State power towards
the government of the United States," testi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>fies
Ames.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> In the Republican view the basis of the
two parties was faith as against disbelief in the ability
of the people to govern themselves; the former
favored the moneyed interests, the latter appealed
to the masses.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Such was the popular doctrine
preached by the opponents of the National Government;
but all economic objections centered in a
common assault on Nationalism.</p>

<p>Thus a clear dividing line was drawn separating
the people into two great political divisions; and
political parties, in the present-day sense of definite
organizations upon fundamental and popularly recognized
principles, began to emerge. Henceforth
the terms "Federalist" and "Republican" mean
opposing party groups, the one standing for the
National and the other for the provincial idea. The
various issues that arose were referred to the
one or the other of these hostile conceptions of
government.</p>

<p>In this rise of political parties the philosophy of
the Constitution was negatived; for our fundamental
law, unlike those of other modern democracies, was
built on the non-party theory and did not contemplate
party government. Its architects did not
foresee parties. Indeed, for several years after the
Constitution was adopted, the term "party" was
used as an expression of reproach. The correspondence
of the period teems with illustrations of this
important fact.</p>

<p>For a considerable time most of the leading men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of the period looked with dread upon the growing
idea of political parties; and the favorite rebuke to
opponents was to accuse them of being a "party"
or a "faction," those designations being used interchangeably.
The "Farewell Address" is a solemn
warning against political parties<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> almost as much
as against foreign alliances.</p>

ought not to meet with the approbation of this House or be

they that the whole subject was dropped by postponement, without

by jury, freedom of speech, the right of the people to assemble, consult,
and "to instruct their representatives," were not guaranteed;

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_146_146" id="Footnote_146_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146_146"><span class="label">[146]</span></a> The House agreed to seventeen amendments. But the Senate
reduced these to twelve, which were submitted to the States. The
first of these provided for an increase of the representation in the
House; the second provided that no law "varying" the salaries of
Senators or Representatives "shall take effect until an election of
Representatives shall have intervened." (<i>Annals</i>, 1st Cong., 1st
Sess., Appendix to ii, 2033.) The States ratified only the last ten.
(For good condensed treatment of the subject see Hildreth, iv, 112-24.)
Thus the Tenth Amendment, as ratified, was the twelfth as submitted
and is sometimes referred to by the latter number in the documents
and correspondence of 1790-91, as in Jefferson's "Opinion on
the Constitutionality of the Bank of the United States." (See <i>infra</i>.)
New York, Virginia, Maryland, South Carolina, North Carolina, and
Rhode Island accepted the twelve amendments as proposed. The
other States rejected one or both of the first two amendments.</p></div>

enemy, while unsparing in his personal abuse, paid high tribute
to the wisdom and necessity of Hamilton's financial statesmanship.
"I know not," writes Adams, "how Hamilton could have done otherwise."
(Adams to Rush, Aug. 23, 1805; <i>Old Family Letters</i>, 75.) "The
sudden rise of public securities, after the establishment of the funding
system was no misfortune to the Public but an advantage. The
necessity of that system arose from the inconsistency of the People
in contracting debts and then refusing to pay them." (Same to same,
Jan. 25, 1806; <i>ib.</i>, 93.)
</p><p>
Fisher Ames thus states the different interests of the sections: "The
funding system, they [Southern members of Congress] say, is in favor
of the moneyed interest&mdash;oppressive to the land; that is, favorable to
us [Northern people], hard on them. They pay tribute, they say, and
the middle and eastern people ... receive it. And here is the burden
of the song, almost all the little [certificates of State or Continental
debts] that they had and which cost them twenty shillings, for supplies
or services, has been bought up, at a low rate, and now they pay
more tax towards the interest than they received for the paper.
This <i>tribute</i>, they say, is aggravating." (Ames to Minot, Nov. 30,
1791; <i>Works</i>: Ames, i, 104.)</p></div>

Virginia was becoming very hostile to the new Government. First,
there was a report that Congress was about to emancipate the slaves.
Then came the news of the Assumption of the State debts, with the
presence in Virginia of speculators from other States buying up State
securities; and this added gall to the bitter cup which Virginians felt
the National Government was forcing them to drink. Finally the
tidings that the Senate had defeated the motion for public sessions
inflamed the public mind still more. (Stuart to Washington, June 2,
1790; <i>Writings</i>: Ford, xi, footnote to 482.)
</p><p>
Even close friends of Washington deeply deplored a "spirit so subversive
of the true principles of the constitution.... If Mr. Henry has
sufficient boldness to aim the blow at its [Constitution's] existence,
which he has threatened, I think he can never meet with a more
favorable opportunity if the assumption should take place." (<i>Ib.</i>)
</p><p>
Washington replied that Stuart's letter pained him. "The public
mind in Virginia ... seems to be more irritable, sour, and discontented
than ... it is in any other State in the Union except Massachusetts."
(Washington to Stuart, June 15, 1790; <i>ib.</i>, 481-82.)
</p><p>
Marshall's father most inaccurately reported to Washington that
Kentucky favored the measures of the Administration; and the President,
thanking him for the welcome news, asked the elder Marshall
for "any information of a public or private nature ... from your
district." (Washington to Thomas Marshall, Feb., 1791; Washington's
Letter Book, MS., Lib. Cong.) Kentucky was at that time in
strong opposition and this continued to grow.</p></div>

<h3>LEADING THE VIRGINIA FEDERALISTS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I think nothing better could be done than to make him [Marshall] a judge.
(Jefferson to Madison, June 29, 1792.)</p>

<p>To doubt the holiness of the French cause was the certain road to odium and
proscription. (Alexander Graydon.)</p>

<p>The trouble and perplexities have worn away my mind. (Washington.)</p></div>


<p>In Richmond, Marshall was growing ever stronger
in his belief in Nationalism. Hamilton's immortal
plea for a vital interpretation of the fundamental
law of the Nation and his demonstration of the
constitutionality of extensive implied powers was
a clear, compact statement of what Marshall himself
had been thinking. The time was coming when
he would announce it in language still more lucid,
expressive of a reasoning even more convincing.
Upon Hamilton's constitutional doctrine John Marshall
was to place the seal of finality.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>But Marshall did not delay until that great hour
to declare his Nationalist opinions. Not only did he
fight for them in the House of Delegates; but in his
club at Farmicola's Tavern, on the street corners,
riding the circuit, he argued for the constitutionality
and wisdom of those measures of Washington's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Administration which strengthened and broadened
the powers of the National Government.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Although he spoke his mind, in and out of season,
for a cause increasingly unpopular, Marshall, as yet,
lost little favor with the people. At a time when
political controversy severed friendship and interrupted
social relations,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> his personality still held
sway over his associates regardless of their political
convictions. Even Mason, the ultra-radical foe of
broad National powers, wrote, at this heated juncture,
that Marshall "is an intimate friend of mine."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>His winning frankness, easy manner, and warm-heartedness
saved him from that dislike which his
bold views otherwise would have created. "Independent
principles, talents, and integrity are denounced
[in Virginia] as badges of aristocracy; but
if you add to these good manners and a decent
appearance, his political death is decreed without
the benefit of a hearing," testifies Francis Corbin.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>"Independent principles, talents, and integrity"
Marshall possessed in fullest measure, as all admitted;
but his manners were far from those which
men like the modish Corbin called "good," and his
appearance would not have passed muster under the
critical eye of that fastidious and disgruntled young
Federalist. We shall soon hear Jefferson denouncing
Marshall's deportment as the artifice of a cunning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and hypocritical craft. As yet, however, Jefferson
saw in Marshall only an extremely popular young
man who was fast becoming the most effective supporter
in Virginia of the National Government.</p>

<p>In the year of the Bank Act, Jefferson and Madison
went on their eventful "vacation," swinging up
the Hudson and through New England. During this
journey Jefferson drew around Madison "the magic
circle" of his compelling charm and won entirely to
the extreme Republican cause<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> the invaluable aid
of that superb intellect. In agreement as to common
warfare upon the Nationalist measures of the Administration,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
the two undoubtedly talked over the
Virginia Federalists.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's repeated successes at the polls with a
constituency hostile to the young lawyer's views particularly
impressed them. Might not Marshall become
a candidate for Congress? If elected, here would
be a skillful, dauntless, and captivating supporter of
all Nationalist measures in the House of Representatives.
What should be done to avert this misfortune?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Jefferson's dexterous intellect devised the idea of
getting rid of Marshall, politically, by depositing
him on the innocuous heights of the State bench.
Better, far better, to make Marshall a Virginia judge
than to permit him to become a Virginia Representative
in Congress. So, upon his return, Jefferson
wrote to Madison:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I learn that he [Hamilton] has expressed the
strongest desire that Marshall should come into
Congress from Richmond, declaring that there is
no man in Virginia whom he wishes so much to see
there; and I am told that Marshall has expressed
half a mind to come. Hence I conclude that Hamilton
has plyed him well with flattery &amp; sollicitation
and I think nothing better could be done than to
make him a judge."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Hamilton's "plying" Marshall with "flattery &amp;
solicitation" occurred only in Jefferson's teeming,
but abnormally suspicious, mind. Marshall was in
Virginia all this time, as his Account Book proves,
while Hamilton was in New York, and no letters
seem to have passed between them.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> But Jefferson's
information that his fellow Secretary wished the
Nationalist Richmond attorney in Congress was
probably correct. Accounts of Marshall's striking
ability and of his fearless zeal in support of the Administration's
measures had undoubtedly reached
Hamilton, perhaps through Washington himself;
and so sturdy and capable a Federalist in Congress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
from Virginia would have been of great strategic
value.</p>

<p>But Jefferson might have spared his pains to dispose
of Marshall by cloistering him on the State
bench. Nothing could have induced the busy lawyer
to go to Congress at this period. It would have
been fatal to his law practice<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> which he had built
up until it was the largest in Richmond and upon
the returns from which his increasing family depended
for support. Six years later, Washington himself
labored with Marshall for four days before he
could persuade him to stand for the National House,
and Marshall then yielded to his adored leader only
as a matter of duty, at one of the Nation's most
critical hours, when war was on the horizon.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>The break-up of Washington's Cabinet was now
approaching. Jefferson was keeping pace with the
Anti-Nationalist sentiment of the masses&mdash;drilling
his followers into a sternly ordered political force.
"The discipline of the [Republican] party," wrote
Ames, "is as severe as the Prussian."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Jefferson and
Madison had secured an organ in the "National
Gazette,"<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> edited by Freneau, whom Jefferson employed
as translator in the State Department.
Through this paper Jefferson attacked Hamilton
without mercy. The spirited Secretary of the Treas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ury
keenly resented the opposition of his Cabinet
associate which was at once covert and open.</p>

<p>In vain the President pathetically begged Jefferson
for harmony and peace.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Jefferson responded
with a bitter attack on Hamilton. "I was duped,"
said he, "by the Secretary of the Treasury and made
a tool for forwarding his schemes, not then sufficiently
understood by me."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> To somewhat, but not
much, better purpose did Washington ask Hamilton
for "mutual forbearances."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Hamilton replied with
spirit, yet pledged his honor that he would "not,
directly or indirectly, say or do a thing that shall
endanger a feud."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The immense speculation, which had unavoidably
grown out of the Assumption and Funding Acts, inflamed
popular resentment against the whole financial
statesmanship of the Federalists.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> More material,
this, for the hands of the artificer who was
fashioning the Republican Party into a capacious
vessel into which the people might pour all their
discontent, all their fears, all their woes and all their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
hopes. And Jefferson, with practical skill, used for
that purpose whatever material he could find.</p>

<p>Still more potter's earth was brought to Jefferson.
The National Courts were at work. Creditors were
securing judgments for debts long due them. In
Virginia the debtors of British merchants, who for
many years had been rendered immune from payment,
were brought to the bar of this "alien" tribunal.
Popular feeling ran high. A resolution was
introduced into the House of Delegates requesting
the Virginia Senators and Representatives in Congress
to "adopt such measures as will tend, not only
to suspend all executions and the proceedings
thereon, but prevent any future judgments to be
given by the Federal Courts in favor of British creditors
until" Great Britain surrendered the posts
and runaway negroes.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Thus was the practical overthrow
of the National Judiciary proposed.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>Nor was this all. A State had been haled before a
National Court.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The Republicans saw in this the
monster "consolidation." The Virginia Legislature
passed a resolution instructing her Senators and
Representatives to "unite their utmost and earliest
exertions" to secure a constitutional amendment
preventing a State from being sued "in any court of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the United States."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> The hostility to the National
Bank took the form of a resolution against a director
or stockholder of the Bank of the United States being
a Senator or Representative in Congress.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> But apparently
this trod upon the toes of too many ambitious
Virginians, for the word "stockholders" was
stricken out.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>The slander that the Treasury Department had
misused the public funds had been thoroughly answered;<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
but the Legislature of Virginia by a majority
of 111 out of a total vote of 124, applauded her
Senators and Representatives who had urged the
inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Such was the developing temper of Republicanism
as revealed by the emotionless pages
of the public records; but these furnish scarcely a
hint of the violence of public opinion.</p>

<p>Jefferson was now becoming tigerish in his assaults
on the measures of the Administration. Many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
members of Congress had been holders of certificates
which Assumption and Funding had made
valuable. Most but not all of them had voted for
every feature of Hamilton's financial plan.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Three
or four were directors of the Bank, but no dishonesty
existed.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Heavy speculation went on in
Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> This, said Republicans, was the
fruit which Hamilton's Nationalist financial scheme
gathered from the people's industry to feed to
"monocrats."</p>

<p>"Here [Philadelphia]," wrote Jefferson, "<i>the unmonied
farmer</i> ... his cattle &amp; corps [<i>sic</i>] are no
more thought of than if they did not feed us. Script
&amp; stock are food &amp; raiment here.... The credit &amp;
fate of the nation seem to hang on the desperate
throws &amp; plunges of gambling scoundrels."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> But
Jefferson comforted himself with the prophecy that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
"this nefarious business" would finally "tumble its
authors headlong from their heights."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>The National law taxing whiskey particularly
aroused the wrath of the multitude. Here it was at
last!&mdash;a direct tax laid upon the universal drink of
the people, as the razor-edged Pennsylvania resolutions
declared.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Here it was, just as the patriotic
foes of the abominable National Constitution had
predicted when fighting the ratification of that "oppressive"
instrument. Here was the exciseman at
every man's door, just as Henry and Mason and
Grayson had foretold&mdash;and few were the doors in
the back counties of the States behind which the
owner's private still was not simmering.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> And why
was this tribute exacted? To provide funds required
by the corrupt Assumption and Funding
laws, asserted the agitators.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Again it was the National Government that was
to blame; in laying the whiskey tax it had invaded
the rights of the States, hotly declared the Republicans.
"All that powerful party," Marshall bears
witness, "which attached itself to the local [State]
rather than to the general [National] government ...
considered ... a tax by Congress on any domestic
manufacture as the intrusion of a foreign power into
their particular concerns which excited serious apprehensions
for state importance and for liberty."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The
tariff did not affect most people, especially those in
the back country, because they used few or no imported
articles; but the whiskey tax did reach them,
directly and personally.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Should such a despotic law be obeyed? Never! It
was oppressive! It was wicked! Above all, it was
"unconstitutional"! But what to do! The agencies
of the detested and detestable National Government
were at work! To arms, then! That was the only
thing left to outraged freemen about to be ravaged
of their liberty!<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Thus came the physical defiance
of the law in Pennsylvania; Washington's third
proclamation<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> demanding obedience to the National
statutes after his earnest pleas<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> to the disaffected
to observe the laws; the march of the troops accompanied
by Hamilton<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> against the insurgents; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
forcible suppression of this first armed assault on
the laws of the United States in which men had been
killed, houses burned, mails pillaged&mdash;all in the
name of the Constitution,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> which the Republicans
now claimed as their peculiar property.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Foremost in the fight for the whiskey insurgents
were the democratic societies, which, as has been
seen, were the offspring of the French Jacobin
Clubs. Washington finally became certain that these
organizations had inspired this uprising against
National law and authority. While the Whiskey
Rebellion was economic in its origin, yet it was sustained
by the spirit which the French Revolution
had kindled in the popular heart. Indeed, when the
troops sent to put down the insurrection reached
Harrisburg, they found the French flag flying over
the courthouse.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's old comrade in the Revolution, close
personal friend, and business partner,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Henry Lee,
was now Governor of Virginia. He stood militantly
with Washington and it was due to Lee's efforts that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the Virginia militia responded to help suppress the
Whiskey Rebellion. He was made Commander-in-Chief
of all the forces that actually took the field.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
To Lee, therefore, Washington wrote with unrestrained
pen.</p>

<p>"I consider," said the President, "this insurrection
as the first <i>formidable</i> fruit of the Democratic
Societies ... instituted by ... <i>artful and designing</i>
members [of Congress] ... to sow the seeds of jealousy
and distrust among the people of the government....
I see, under a display of popular and
fascinating guises, the most diabolical attempts to
destroy ... the government."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> He declared: "That
they have been the fomenters of the western disturbances
admits of no doubt."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Never was that emphatic man more decided than
now; he was sure, he said, that, unless lawlessness
were overcome, republican government was at an
end, "and nothing but anarchy and confusion is to
be expected hereafter."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> If "the daring and factious
spirit" is not crushed, "adieu to all government in
this country, except mob and club government."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Such were Washington's positive and settled
opinions, and they were adopted and maintained
by Marshall, his faithful supporter.</p>

<p>And not only by argument and speech did Marshall
uphold the measures of Washington's Adminis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>tration.
In 1793 he had been commissioned as Brigadier-General
of Militia, and when the President's
requisition came for Virginia troops to enforce the
National revenue law against those who were violently
resisting the execution of it, he was placed in
command of one of the detachments to be raised for
that purpose.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Although it is not established that
his brigade was ordered to Pennsylvania, the probabilities
are that it was and that Marshall, in command
of it, was on the scene of the first armed opposition
to the National Government. And it is certain
that Marshall was busy and effective in the work of
raising and properly equipping the troops for duty.
He suggested practical plans for expediting the muster
and for economizing the expenditure of the public
money, and his judgment was highly valued.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>All the ability, experience, and zeal at the disposal
of the State were necessary, for the whiskey tax was
only less disliked in Virginia than in Pennsylvania,
and a portion of the Commonwealth was inclined
to assist rather than to suppress the insurrection.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
Whether or not he was one of the military force that,
on the ground, overawed the whiskey insurgents,
it is positively established that Marshall was ready,
in person, to help put down with arms all forcible
opposition to the National laws and authority.</p>

<p>Jefferson, now the recognized commander-in-chief
of the new party, was, however, heartily with the
popular outbreak. He had approved Washington's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
first proclamations against the whiskey producers;<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
but, nevertheless, as the anger of the people grew, it
found Jefferson responsive. "The excise law is an
infernal one," he cried; the rebellion against it,
nothing more than "riotous" at the worst.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>And Jefferson wielded his verbal cat-o'-nine-tails
on Washington's order to put the rebellion down
by armed forces.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> It was all "for the favorite purpose
of strengthening government and increasing
public debt."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Washington thought the Whiskey
Rebellion treasonable; and Jefferson admitted that
"there was ... a meeting to consult about a separation"
from the Union; but talking was not acting.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
Thus the very point was raised which Marshall
enforced in the Burr trial twelve years later, when
Jefferson took exactly opposite grounds. But to take
the popular view now made for Republican solidarity
and strength. Criticism is ever more profitable
politics than building.</p>

<p>All this had different effects on different public
men. The Republican Party was ever growing
stronger, and under Jefferson's skillful guidance, was
fast becoming a seasoned political army. The sentiment
of the multitude against the National Government
continued to rise. But instead of weakening
John Marshall's Nationalist principles, this turbulent
opposition strengthened and hardened them. So
did other and larger events of that period which tumultuously
crowded fast upon one another's heels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
As we have seen, the horrors of the Reign of Terror
in Paris did not chill the frenzied enthusiasm of the
masses of Americans for France. "By a strange kind
of reasoning," wrote Oliver Wolcott to his brother,
"some suppose the liberties of America depend on
the right of cutting throats in France."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>In the spring of 1793 France declared war against
England. The popular heart in America was hot for
France, the popular voice loud against England. The
idea that the United States was an independent nation
standing aloof from foreign quarrels did not enter
the minds of the people. But it was Washington's one
great conception. It was not to make the American
people the tool of any foreign government that he
had drawn his sword for their independence. It was
to found a separate nation with dignity and rights
equal to those of any other nation; a nation friendly
to all, and allied with none<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>&mdash;this was the supreme
purpose for which he had fought, toiled, and suffered.
And Washington believed that only on this
broad highway could the American people travel
to ultimate happiness and power.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> He determined
upon a policy of absolute impartiality.</p>

<p>On the same day that the Minister of the new
French Republic landed on American shores, Wash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>ington
proclaimed Neutrality.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> This action, which
to-day all admit to have been wise and far-seeing
statesmanship, then caused an outburst of popular
resentment against Neutrality and the Administration
that had dared to take this impartial stand. For
the first time Washington was openly abused by
Americans.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>"A great majority of the American people deemed
it criminal to remain unconcerned spectators of a
conflict between their ancient enemy [Great Britain]
and republican France," declares Marshall. The
people, he writes, thought Great Britain was waging
war "with the sole purpose of imposing a monarchical
government on the French people. The few who
did not embrace these opinions, and they were certainly
very few, were held up as objects of public
detestation; and were calumniated as the tools of
Britain and the satellites of despotism."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The National Government was ungrateful, cried
the popular voice; it was aiding the tyrants of Europe
against a people struggling for freedom; it was
cowardly, infamous, base. "Could any friend of his
kind be neutral?" was the question on the popular
tongue; of course not! unless, indeed, the miscreant
who dared to be exclusively American was a monarchist
at heart. "To doubt the holiness of their
[the French] cause was the certain road to odium<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and proscription," testifies an observer.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The Republican
press, following Paine's theory, attacked "all
governments, including that of the United States,
as naturally hostile to the liberty of the people,"
asserts Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Few were the friends of Neutrality
outside of the trading and shipping interests.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson, although still in Washington's Cabinet,
spoke of "the pusillanimity of the proclamation"<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
and of "the sneaking neutrality" it set up.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> "In
every effort made by the executive to maintain the
neutrality of the United States," writes Marshall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
"that great party [Republican] which denominated
itself '<span class="smcap">The People</span>' could perceive only a settled
hostility to France and to liberty."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>And, of course, Washington's proclamation of
Neutrality was "unconstitutional," shouted the Republican
politicians. Hamilton quickly answered.
The power to deal with foreign affairs was, he said,
lodged somewhere in the National Government.
Where, then? Plainly not in the Legislative or Judicial
branches, but in the Executive Department,
which is "the <i>organ</i> of intercourse between the nation
and foreign nations" and "the <i>interpreter</i> of ...
treaties in those cases in which the judiciary is not
competent&mdash;that is between government and government....
The <i>executive power</i> of the United
States is completely lodged in the President," with
only those exceptions made by the Constitution, as
that of declaring war. But if it is the right of Congress
to declare war, "it is the duty of the Executive
to preserve peace till the declaration is made."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Washington's refusal to take sides in the European
war was still more fuel for the Republican furnace.
The bill to maintain Neutrality escaped defeat
in Congress by a dangerously narrow margin: on
amendments and motions in the Senate it was rescued
time and again only by the deciding vote of
the Vice-President.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> In the House, resolutions were
introduced which, in the perspective of history, were
stupid. Public speakers searched for expressions
strong enough for the popular taste; the newspapers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
blazed with denunciation. "The artillery of the
press," declares Marshall, "was played with unceasing
fury on" the supporters of Neutrality; "and the
democratic societies brought their whole force into
operation. Language will scarcely afford terms of
greater outrage, than were employed against those
who sought to stem the torrent of public opinion
and to moderate the rage of the moment."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>At the most effective hour, politically, Jefferson
resigned<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> from the Cabinet, as he had declared, two
years before, he intended to do.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> He had prepared
well for popular leadership. His stinging criticism
of the Nationalist financial measures, his warm
championship of France, his bitter hostility to Great
Britain, and most of all, his advocacy of the popular
view of the Constitution, secured him the favor of
the people. Had he remained Secretary of State, he
would have found himself in a hazardous political
situation. But now, freed from restraint, he could
openly lead the Republican forces which so eagerly
awaited his formal command.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>As in the struggle for the Constitution, so now
Neutrality was saved by the combined efforts of
the mercantile and financial interests who dreaded
the effect of the war on business and credit;<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the disinterested support of those who wished the
United States to become a nation, distinct from,
unconnected with, and unsubservient to any other
government.</p>

<p>Among these latter was John Marshall, although
he also held the view of the commercial classes from
which most of his best clients came; and his personal
loyalty to Washington strengthened his opinions.
Hot as Virginia was against the Administration,
Marshall was equally hot in its favor. Although he
was the most prudent of men, and in Virginia silence
was the part of discretion for those who approved
Washington's course, Marshall would not be still.
He made speeches in support of Washington's stand,
wrote pamphlets, and appealed in every possible
way to the solid reason and genuine Americanism of
his neighbors. He had, of course, read Hamilton's
great defense of Neutrality; and he asserted that
sound National policy required Neutrality and that
it was the duty of the President to proclaim and
enforce it. Over and over again, by tongue and pen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
he demonstrated the constitutional right of the
Executive to institute and maintain the Nation's
attitude of aloofness from foreign belligerents.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Marshall rallied the friends of the Administration,
not only in Richmond, but elsewhere in Virginia.
"The [Administration] party in Richmond was soon
set in motion," Monroe reported to Jefferson; "from
what I have understood here [I] have reason to
believe they mean to produce the most extensive
effect they are capable of. M<sup><span class="u">r</span></sup> Marshall has written
G. Jones<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> on the subject and the first appearances
threatened the most furious attack on the French
Minister [Gen&ecirc;t]."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>At last Marshall's personal popularity could no
longer save him from open and public attack. The
enraged Republicans assailed him in pamphlets;
he was criticized in the newspapers; his character
was impugned.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> He was branded with what, in
Virginia, was at that time the ultimate reproach:
Marshall, said the Republicans, was the friend and
follower of Alexander Hamilton, the monarchist,
the financial manipulator, the father of Assumption,
the inventor of the rotten Funding system, the
designer of the stock-jobbing Bank of the United
States, and, worst of all, the champion of a power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>ful
Nationalism and the implacable foe of the sovereignty
of the States.</p>

<p>Spiritedly Marshall made reply. He was, indeed,
a disciple of Washington's great Secretary of the
Treasury, he said, and proud of it; and he gloried
in his fealty to Washington, for which also he had
been blamed. In short, Marshall was aggressively
for the Administration and all its measures. These
were right, he said, and wise and necessary. Above
all, since that was the chief ground of attack, all of
them, from Assumption to Neutrality, were plainly
constitutional. At a public meeting at Richmond,
Marshall offered resolutions which he had drawn
up in support of the Administration's foreign policy,
spoke in their favor, and carried the meeting for
them by a heavy majority.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's bold course cost him the proffer of an
honor. Our strained relations with the Spaniards
required an alert, able, and cool-headed representative
to go to New Orleans. Jefferson<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> confided
to Madison the task of finding such a man in
Virginia. "My imagination has hunted thro' this
whole state," Madison advised the Secretary of
State in reply, "without being able to find a single
character fitted for the mission to N. O. Young
Marshall seems to possess some of the qualifications,
but there would be objections of several sorts to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
him."<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Three months later Madison revealed one
of these "several objections" to Marshall; but the
principal one was his sturdy, fighting Nationalism.
This "objection" was so intense that anybody who
was even a close friend of Marshall was suspected
and proscribed by the Republicans. The Jacobin
Clubs of Paris were scarcely more intolerant than
their disciples in America.</p>

<p>So irritated, indeed, were the Republican leaders
by Marshall's political efforts in support of
Neutrality and other policies of the Administration,
that they began to hint at improper motives. With
his brother, brother-in-law, and General Henry Lee
(then Governor of Virginia) Marshall had purchased
the Fairfax estate.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> This was evidence, said the Republicans,
that he was the tool of the wicked financial
interests. Madison hastened to inform Jefferson.</p>

<p>"The circumstances which derogate from full confidence
in W[ilson] N[icholas]," cautioned Madison,
"are ... his connection &amp; intimacy with Marshall,
of whose <i>disinterestedness</i> as well as understanding
he has the highest opinion. It is said that
Marshall, who is at the head of the great purchase
from Fairfax, has lately obtained pecuniary aids
from the bank [of the United States] or people connected
with it. I think it certain that he must have
felt, in the moment of purchase, an absolute confidence
in the monied interests which will explain
him to everyone that reflects in the active character
he is assuming."<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>In such fashion do the exigencies of politics generate
suspicion and false witness. Marshall received
no money from the Bank for the Fairfax purchase
and it tied him to "the monied interests" in no way
except through business sympathy. He relied for
help on his brother's father-in-law, Robert Morris,
who expected to raise the funds for the Fairfax purchase
from loans negotiated in Europe on the security
of Morris's immense real-estate holdings in America.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
But even the once poised, charitable, and unsuspicious
Madison had now acquired that state of mind
which beholds in any business transaction, no matter
how innocent, something furtive and sinister. His
letter proves, however, that the fearless Richmond
lawyer was making himself effectively felt as a practical
power for Washington's Administration, to the
serious discomfort of the Republican chieftains.</p>

<p>While Marshall was beloved by most of those
who knew him and was astonishingly popular with
the masses, jealousy of his ability and success had
made remorseless enemies for him. It appears, indeed,
that a peculiarly malicious envy had pursued
him almost from the time he had gone to William
and Mary College. His sister-in-law, with hot
resentment, emphasizes this feature of Marshall's
career. "Notwithstanding his amiable and correct
conduct," writes Mrs. Carrington, "there were
those who would catch at the most trifling circumstance
to throw a shade over his fair fame." He had
little education, said his detractors; "his talents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
were greatly overrated"; his habits were bad.
"Tho' no man living ever had more ardent friends,
yet there does not exist one who had at one time
more slanderous enemies."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>These now assailed Marshall with all their pent-up
hatred. They stopped at no charge, hesitated
at no insinuation. For instance, his conviviality was
magnified into reports of excesses and the tale was
carried to the President. "It was cruelly insinuated
to G[eorge] W[ashington]," writes Marshall's sister-in-law,
"by an after great S[olo?]n that to Mr.
M[arsha]lls fondness for play was added an increasing
fondness for liquor." Mrs. Carrington loyally
defends Marshall, testifying, from her personal
knowledge, that "this S&mdash;&mdash;n knew better than
most others how Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;ll always played for
amusement and never, never for gain, and that he
was, of all men, the most temperate."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>Considering the custom of the time<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> and the habits
of the foremost men of that period,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Marshall's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
sister-in-law is entirely accurate. Certainly this political
slander did not impress Washington, for his
confidence in Marshall grew steadily; and, as we shall
presently see, he continued to tender Marshall high
honors and confide to him political tasks requiring
delicate judgment.</p>

<p>Such petty falsehoods did not disturb Marshall's
composure. But he warmly resented the assault
made upon him because of his friendship for Hamilton;
and his anger was hot against what he felt was
the sheer dishonesty of the attacks on the measures
of the National Government. "I wish very much
to see you," writes Marshall to Archibald Stuart at
this time: "I want to observe [illegible] how much
honest men you and I are [illegible] half our acquaintance.
Seriously there appears to me every day to be
more folly, envy, malice, and damn rascality in the
world than there was the day before and I do verily
begin to think that plain downright honesty and
unintriguing integrity will be kicked out of doors."<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>A picturesque incident gave to the Virginia opponents
of Washington's Administration more substantial
cause to hate Marshall than his pamphlets,
speeches, and resolutions had afforded. At Smithfield,
not far from Norfolk, the ship Unicorn was
fitting out as a French privateer. The people of Isle
of Wight County were almost unanimous in their
sympathy with the project, and only seven or eight
men could be procured to assist the United States
Marshal in seizing and holding the vessel.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Twenty-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>five
soldiers and three officers were sent from Norfolk
in a revenue cutter;<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> but the Governor, considering
this force insufficient to outface resistance and take
the ship, dispatched Marshall, with a considerable
body of militia, to Smithfield.</p>

<p>Evidently the affair was believed to be serious;
"the Particular Orders ... to Brigadier General
Marshall" placed under his command forces of cavalry,
infantry, and artillery from Richmond and another
body of troops from Petersburg. The Governor
assures Marshall that "the executive know that
in your hands the dignity and rights of the Commonwealth
will ever be safe and they are also
sure that prudence, affection to our deluded fellow
citizens, and marked obedience to law in the means
you will be compelled to adopt, will equally characterize
every step of your procedure." He is directed
to "collect every information respecting
this daring violation of order," and particularly
"the conduct of the Lieutenant Colonel Commandant
of Isle of Wight," who had disregarded his
instructions.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>Clad in the uniform of a brigadier-general of the
Virginia Militia,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Marshall set out for Smithfield riding
at the head of the cavalry, the light infantry and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
artillery following by boat.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> He found all thought of
resistance abandoned upon his arrival. A "peaceable
search" of Captain Sinclair's house revealed thirteen
cannon with ball, grape-shot, and powder. Three
more pieces of ordnance were stationed on the shore.
Before General Marshall and his cavalry arrived, the
United States Marshal had been insulted, and
threatened with violence. Men had been heard loading
muskets in Sinclair's house, and fifteen of these
weapons, fully charged, were discovered. The house
so "completely commanded the Deck of the" Unicorn
"that ... one hundred men placed in the vessel
could not have protected her ten minutes from
fifteen placed in the house."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>The State and Federal officers had previously been
able to get little aid of any kind, but "since the arrival
of distant militia," reports Marshall, "those of
the County are as prompt as could be wished in rendering
any service required of them," and he suggests
that the commandant of the county, rather
than the men, was responsible for the failure to act
earlier. He at once sent messengers to the infantry
and artillery detachment which had not yet arrived,
with orders that they return to Richmond and
Petersburg.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Marshall "had ... frequent conversations with
individuals of the Isle of Wight" and found them
much distressed at the necessity for calling distant
militia "to protect from violence the laws of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
common country.... The commanding officers [of
the county] ... seem not to have become sufficiently
impressed with the importance of maintaining the
Sovereignty of the law" says Marshall, but with unwarranted
optimism he believes "that a more proper
mode of thinking is beginning to prevail."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>Thus was the Smithfield defiance of Neutrality
and the National laws quelled by strong measures,
taken before it had gathered dangerous headway.
"I am very much indebted to Brig.-Gen'l Marshall
and Major Taylor<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> for their exertions in the execution
of my orders," writes Governor Lee to the
Secretary of War.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>But the efforts of the National Government and
the action of Governor Lee in Virginia to enforce
obedience to National laws and observance of Neutrality,
while they succeeded locally in their immediate
purpose, did not modify the public temper toward
the Administration. Neutrality, in particular,
grew in disfavor among the people. When the congressional
elections of 1794 came on, all complaints
against the National Government were vivified by
that burning question. As if, said the Republicans,
there could be such a status as neutrality between
"right and wrong," between "liberty" and "tyranny."<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Thus, in the campaign, the Republicans made the
French cause their own. Everything that Washing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>ton's
Administration had accomplished was wrong,
said the Republicans, but Neutrality was the work
of the Evil One. The same National power which
had dared to issue this "edict" against American
support of French "liberty" had foisted on the
people Assumption, National Courts, and taxes on
whiskey. This identical Nationalist crew had, said
the Republicans, by Funding and National Banks,
fostered, nay, created, stock-jobbing and speculation
by which the few "monocrats" were made rich,
while the many remained poor. Thus every Republican
candidate for Congress became a knight of the
flaming sword, warring upon all evil, but especially
and for the moment against the dragon of Neutrality
that the National Government had uncaged
to help the monarchs of Europe destroy free government
in France.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Chiefly on that question the
Republicans won the National House of Representatives.</p>

<p>But if Neutrality lit the flames of public wrath,
Washington's next act in foreign affairs was powder
and oil cast upon fires already fiercely burning.
Great Britain, by her war measures against France,
did not spare America. She seized hundreds of
American vessels trading with her enemy and even
with neutrals; in order to starve France<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> she lifted
cargoes from American bottoms; to man her warships
she forcibly took sailors from American ships, "often
leaving scarcely hands enough to navigate the vessel
into port";<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> she conducted herself as if she were
not only mistress of the seas, but their sole pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>prietor.
And the British depredations were committed
in a manner harsh, brutal, and insulting.</p>

<p>Even Marshall was aroused and wrote to his
friend Stuart: "We fear, not without reason, a
war. The man does not live who wishes for peace
more than I do; but the outrages committed upon
us are beyond human bearing. Farewell&mdash;pray
Heaven we may weather the storm."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> If the self-contained
and cautious Marshall felt a just resentment
of British outrage, we may, by that measure,
accurately judge of the inflamed and dangerous
condition of the general sentiment.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the deeply rooted hatred
of the people for their former master<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> was heated
to the point of reckless defiance. This was the same
Monarchy, they truly said, that still kept the military
and trading posts on American soil which, more
than a decade before, it had, by the Treaty of Peace,
solemnly promised to surrender.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> The Government
that was committing these savage outrages was the
same faithless Power, declared the general voice,
that had pledged compensation for the slaves its
armies had carried away, but not one shilling of
which had been paid.</p>

<p>If ever a country had good cause for war, Great
Britain then furnished it to America; and, had we
been prepared, it is impossible to believe that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
should not have taken up arms to defend our ravaged
interests and vindicate our insulted honor. In Congress
various methods of justifiable retaliation were
urged with intense earnestness, marred by loud and
extravagant declamation.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> "The noise of debate
was more deafening than a mill.... We sleep
upon our arms," wrote a member of the National
House.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> But these bellicose measures were rejected
because any one of them would have meant immediate
hostilities.</p>

<p>For we were not prepared. War was the one thing
America could not then afford. Our Government
was still tottering on the unstable legs of infancy.
Orderly society was only beginning and the spirit of
unrest and upheaval was strong and active. In case
of war, wrote Ames, expressing the conservative
fears, "I dread anarchy more than great guns."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
Our resources had been bled white by the Revolution
and the desolating years that followed. We had
no real army, no adequate arsenals,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> no efficient ships
of war; and the French Republic, surrounded by
hostile bayonets and guns and battling for very existence,
could not send us armies, fleets, munitions,
and money as the French Monarchy had done.</p>

<p>Spain was on our south eager for more territory
on the Mississippi, the mouth of which she con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>trolled;
and ready to attack us in case we came to
blows with Great Britain. The latter Power was on
our north, the expelled Loyalists in Canada burning
with that natural resentment<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> which has never
cooled; British soldiers held strategic posts within
our territory; hordes of Indians, controlled and their
leaders paid by Great Britain,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> and hostile to the
United States, were upon our borders anxious to
avenge themselves for the defeats we had inflicted
on them and their kinsmen in the savage wars incited
by their British employers.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Worst of all, British
warships covered the oceans and patrolled every
mile of our shores just beyond American waters. Our
coast defenses, few, poor, and feeble in their best
estate, had been utterly neglected for more than ten
years and every American port was at the mercy
of British guns.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Evidence was not wanting that Great Britain
courted war.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> She had been cold and unresponsive to
every approach for a better understanding with us.
She had not even sent a Minister to our Government
until eight years after the Treaty of Peace had been
signed.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> She not only held our posts, but established<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
a new one fifty miles south of Detroit; and her entire
conduct indicated, and Washington believed,
that she meant to draw a new boundary line which
would give her exclusive possession of the Great
Lakes.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> She had the monopoly of the fur trade<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
and plainly meant to keep it.</p>

<p>Lord Dorchester, supreme representative of the
British Crown in Canada, had made an ominous
speech to the Indians predicting hostilities against
the United States within a year and declaring that
a new boundary line would then be drawn "by the
warriors."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Rumors flew and gained volume and
color in their flight. Even the poised and steady
Marshall was disturbed.</p>

<p>"We have some letters from Philadelphia that
wear a very ugly aspect," he writes Archibald Stuart.
"It is said that Simcoe, the Governor of Upper Canada,
has entered the territory of the United States at
the head of about 500 men and has possessed himself
of Presque Isle." But Marshall cannot restrain his
humor, notwithstanding the gravity of the report:
"As this is in Pennsylvania," he observes, "I hope
the democratic society of Philadelphia will at once
demolish him and if they should fail I still trust that
some of our upper brothers [Virginia Republicans]
will at one stride place themselves by him and prostrate
his post. But seriously," continues Marshall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
"if this be true we must bid adieu to all hope of peace
and prepare for serious war. My only hope is that it
is a mere speculating story."<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Powerless to obtain our rights by force or to prevent
their violation by being prepared to assert them
with arms, Washington had no recourse but to diplomacy.
At all hazards and at any cost, war must
be avoided for the time being. It was one of Great
Britain's critical mistakes that she consented to
treat instead of forcing a conflict with us; for had she
taken the latter course it is not improbable that, at
the end of the war, the southern boundary of British
dominion in America would have been the Ohio
River, and it is not impossible that New York and
New England would have fallen into her hands. At
the very least, there can be little doubt that the
Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence would have become
exclusively British waters.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>Amid a confusion of counsels, Washington determined
to try for a treaty of amity, commerce, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
navigation with Great Britain, a decision, the outcome
of which was to bring Marshall even more conspicuously
into politics than he ever had been before.
Indeed, the result of the President's policy, and
Marshall's activity in support of it, was to become
one of the important stepping-stones in the latter's
career.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Jay was selected for the infinitely
delicate task of negotiation. Even the news of
such a plan was received with stinging criticism.
What! Kiss the hand that smote us! It was "a
degrading insult to the American people; a pusillanimous
surrender of their honor; and an insidious
injury to France."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> And our envoy to carry out this
shameful programme!&mdash;was it not that same Jay
who once tried to barter away the Mississippi?<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>It was bad enough to turn our backs on France;
but to treat with the British Government was infamous.
So spoke the voice of the people. The
democratic societies were especially virulent; "Let
us unite with France and stand or fall together"<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
was their heroic sentiment. But abhorrence of the
mission did not blind the Republicans to the advantages
of political craft. While the negotiations
were in progress they said that, after all, everything
would be gained that America desired, knowing that
they could say afterward, as they did and with just
cause, that everything had been lost.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>At last Jay secured from Great Britain the famous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
treaty that bears his name. It is perhaps the most
humiliating compact into which America ever entered.
He was expected to secure the restriction
of contraband&mdash;it was enlarged; payment for the
slaves&mdash;it was refused; recognition of the principle
that "free ships make free goods"&mdash;it was denied;
equality with France as to belligerent rights&mdash;it
was not granted; opening of the West Indian trade&mdash;it
was conceded upon hard and unjust conditions;
payment for British spoliation of American
commerce&mdash;it was promised at some future time,
but even then only on the award of a commission;
immediate surrender of the posts&mdash;their evacuation
was agreed to, but not until a year and a half after
the treaty was signed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the British secured from us
free navigation and trading rights on the Mississippi&mdash;never
contemplated; agreement that the United
States would pay all debts due from American citizens
to British creditors&mdash;a claim never admitted
hitherto; prohibition of any future sequestration of
British debts; freedom of all American ports to British
vessels, with a pledge to lay no further restrictions
on British commerce&mdash;never before proposed;
liberty of Indians and British subjects to pass our
frontiers, trade on our soil, retain lands occupied
without becoming American citizens, but privileged
to become such at pleasure&mdash;an odious provision,
which, formerly, had never occurred to anybody.</p>

<p>Thus, by the Treaty of 1794, we yielded everything
and gained little not already ours. But we secured
peace; we were saved from war. That supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
end was worth the sacrifice and that, alone, justified
it. It more than demonstrated the wisdom of the
Jay Treaty.</p>

<p>While the Senate was considering the bitter terms
which Great Britain, with unsheathed sword, had
forced upon us, Senator Stephen T. Mason of Virginia,
in violation of the Senate rules, gave a copy
of the treaty to the press.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Instantly the whole land
shook with a tornado of passionate protest.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> From
one end of the country to the other, public meetings
were held. Boston led off.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Washington was smothered
with violent petitions that poured in upon him
from every quarter praying, demanding, that he withhold
his assent.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> As in the struggle for the Constitution
and in the violent attacks on Neutrality, so now
the strongest advocates of the Jay Treaty were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
commercial interests. "The common opinion among
men of business of all descriptions is," declares Hamilton,
"that a disagreement would greatly shock
and stagnate pecuniary plans and operations in
general."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>The printing presses belched pamphlets and
lampoons, scurrilous, inflammatory, even indecent.
An example of these was a Boston screed. This
classic of vituperation, connecting the treaty with
the financial measures of Washington's Administration,
represented the Federalist leaders as servants
of the Devil; Independence, after the death of his
first wife, Virtue, married a foul creature, Vice, and
finally himself expired in convulsions, leaving Speculation,
Bribery, and Corruption as the base offspring
of his second marriage.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>Everywhere Jay was burned in effigy. Hamilton
was stoned in New York when he tried to speak to
the mob; and with the blood pouring down his face
went, with the few who were willing to listen to
him, to the safety of a hall.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Even Washington's
granite resolution was shaken. Only once in our
history have the American people so scourged a
great public servant.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> He was no statesman, raged
the Republicans; everybody knew that he had been
a failure as a soldier, they said; and now, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
trampled on the Constitution and betrayed America,
let him be impeached, screamed the infuriated
opposition.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Seldom has any measure of our Government
awakened such convulsions of popular feeling
as did the Jay Treaty, which, surrendering our
righteous and immediate demands, yet saved our
future. Marshall, watching it all, prepared to defend
the popularly abhorred compact; and thus he was
to become its leading defender in the South.</p>

<p>When, finally, Washington reluctantly approved
its ratification by the Senate,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> many of his friends
deserted him.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> "The trouble and perplexities ...
have worn away my mind," wrote the abused and
distracted President.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Mercer County, Kentucky,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
denounced Senator Humphrey Marshall for voting
for ratification and demanded a constitutional
amendment empowering State Legislatures to recall
Senators at will.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The Legislature of Virginia
actually passed a resolution for an amendment of
the National Constitution to make the House
of Representatives a part of the treaty-making
power.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The Lexington, Kentucky, resolutions
branded the treaty as "shameful to the American
name."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> It was reported that at a dinner in Virginia
this toast was drunk: "A speedy death to
General Washington."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Orators exhausted invective;
poets wrote in the ink of gall.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson, in harmony, of course, with the public
temper, was against the treaty. "So general a burst
of dissatisfaction," he declared, "never before appeared
against any transaction.... The whole body
of the people ... have taken a greater interest in
this transaction than they were ever known to do
in any other."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The Republican chieftain carefully
observed the effect of the popular commotion on his
own and the opposite party. "It has in my opinion
completely demolished the monarchical party here<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
[Virginia]." Jefferson thought the treaty itself so
bad that it nearly turned him against all treaties.
"I am not satisfied," said he, "we should not be
better without treaties with any nation. But I
am satisfied we should be better without such as
this."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>The deadliest charge against the treaty was the
now familiar one of "unconstitutionality." Many
urged that the President had no power to begin
negotiations without the assent of the Senate;<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> and
all opponents agreed that it flagrantly violated the
Constitution in several respects, especially in regulating
trade, to do which was the exclusive province
of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> Once more, avowed the Jeffersonians, it
was the National Government which had brought
upon America this disgrace. "Not one in a thousand
would have resisted Great Britain ... in the be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>ginning
of the Revolution" if the vile conduct of
Washington had been foreseen; and it was plain, at
this late day, that "either the Federal or State
governments must fall"&mdash;so wrote Republican
pamphleteers, so spoke Republican orators.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Again Hamilton brought into action the artillery
of his astounding intellect. In a series of public letters
under the signature of "Camillus," he vindicated
every feature of the treaty, evading nothing,
conceding nothing. These papers were his last great
constructive work. In numbers three, six, thirty-seven,
and thirty-eight of "Camillus," he expounded
the Constitution on the treaty-making power; demonstrated
the exclusive right of the President to
negotiate, and, with the Senate, to conclude, treaties;
and proved, not only that the House should
not be consulted, but that it is bound by the Constitution
itself to pass all laws necessary to carry
treaties into effect.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>Fearless, indeed, and void of political ambition
were those who dared to face the tempest. "The
cry against the Treaty is like that against a mad-dog,"
wrote Washington from Mount Vernon.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Particularly
was this true of Virginia, where it raged un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>governably.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
A meeting of Richmond citizens "have
outdone all that has gone before them" in the resolutions
passed,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> bitterly complained Washington.
Virginians, testified Jefferson, "were never more
unanimous. 4. or 5. individuals of Richmond, distinguished
however, by their talents as by their
devotion to all the sacred acts of the government, &amp;
the town of Alexandria constitute the whole support
of that instrument [Jay Treaty] here."<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> These four
or five devoted ones, said Jefferson, were "Marshall,
Carrington, Harvey, Bushrod Washington, Doctor
Stewart."<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> But, as we are now to see, Marshall made
up in boldness and ability what the Virginia friends
of the Administration lacked in numbers.</p>

under the Constitution of the United States, be made a defendant at the
suit of any individual or individuals, and that the decision of the
Supreme Federal Court, that a State may be placed in that situation,
is incompatible with, and dangerous to the sovereignty and independence
of the individual States, as the same tends to a general consolidation
of these confederated republics." Virginia Senators were
"instructed" to make "their utmost exertions" to secure an amendment
to the Constitution regarding suits against States. The Governor
was directed to send the Virginia resolution to all the other States.

in the sale of land, in the purchase of goods, in that of bills of

display of riches in the Capital. "The profusion of luxury of Philadelphia,
on great days, at the tables of the wealthy, in their equipages

seen balls on the President's birthday where the splendor of the rooms,
and the variety and richness of the dresses did not suffer, in comparison
with Europe." The extravagance extended to working-men who,
on Sundays, spent money with amazing lavishness. Even negro servants
had balls; and negresses with wages of one dollar per week
wore dresses costing sixty dollars. (<i>Ib.</i>, 107-09.)</p></div>

<i>Econ. O. J. D.</i>, 250.) Whiskey was used as a circulating medium.
(McMaster, ii, 29.) Every contemporary traveler tells of the numerous
private stills in Pennsylvania and the South. Practically all
farmers, especially in the back country, had their own apparatus for
making whiskey or brandy. (See chap. <span class="smcap">vii</span>, vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>, of this work.)
</p><p>
Nor was this industry confined to the lowly and the frontiersmen.
Washington had a large distillery. (Washington to William Augustine
Washington, Feb. 27, 1798; <i>Writings</i>: Ford, xiii, 444.)
</p><p>
New England's rum, on the other hand, was supplied by big distilleries;
and these could include the tax in the price charged the consumer.
Thus the people of Pennsylvania and the South felt the tax
personally, while New Englanders were unconscious of it. Otherwise
there doubtless would have been a New England "rum rebellion,"
as Shays's uprising and as New England's implied threat in the Assumption
fight would seem to prove. (See Beard: <i>Econ. O. J. D.</i>,

While the Republicans charged that Washington's Neutrality was
inspired by favoritism to Great Britain, as it was certainly championed
by trading and moneyed interests which dealt chiefly with British
houses, the Federalists made the counter-charge, with equal accuracy,
that the opponents of Neutrality were French partisans and encouraged
by those financially interested.
</p><p>
The younger Adams, who was in Europe during most of this period
and who carefully informed himself, writing from The Hague, declared
that many Americans, some of them very important men, were
"debtors to British merchants, creditors to the French government,
and speculators in the French revolutionary funds, all to an immense
amount," and that other Americans were heavily indebted in England.
All these interests were against Neutrality and in favor of war with
Great Britain&mdash;those owing British debts, because "war ... would
serve as a sponge for their debts," or at least postpone payment, and
the creditors of the French securities, because French success would
insure payment. (J. Q. Adams to his father, June 24, 1796; <i>Writings,
J. Q. A.</i>: Ford, i, 506.)</p></div>

"I say the treaty is a good one ... for I do not think about it....
What did we choose the Senate for ... but to think for us.... Let
the people remember that it is their sacred right to submit and obey;
and that all those who would persuade them that they have a right to

Jay Treaty and Neutrality must be considered together, if the temper
of the times is to be understood. "If our neutrality be still preserved,
it will be due to the President alone," writes the younger Adams
from Europe. "Nothing but his weight of character and reputation,
combined with his firmness and political intrepidity could have
stood against the torrent that is still tumbling with a fury that resounds
even across the Atlantic.... If his system of administration
now prevails, ten years more will place the United States among

powerful party at home and a mighty influence from abroad, are
joining all their forces to assail his reputation, and his character I

<h3>WASHINGTON'S DEFENDER</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>His [Marshall's] lax, lounging manners have made him popular. (Jefferson.)</p>

<p>Having a high opinion of General Marshall's honor, prudence, and judgment,
consult him. (Washington.)</p>

<p>The man [Washington] who is the source of all the misfortunes of our country
is no longer possessed of the power to multiply evils on the United States.
(The <i>Aurora</i> on Washington's retirement from the Presidency.)</p></div>


<p>Jefferson properly named Marshall as the first
of Washington's friends in Virginia. For, by now,
he had become the leader of the Virginia Federalists.
His lucid common sense, his level poise, his steady
courage, his rock-like reliability&mdash;these qualities,
together with his almost uncanny influence over his
constituents, had made him chief in the Virginia
Federalist councils.</p>

<p>So high had Marshall risen in Washington's esteem
and confidence that the President urged him
to become a member of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>"The office of Attorney Gen<sup>l&#803;</sup> of the United States
has become vacant by the death of Will Bradford,
Esq.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> I take the earliest opportunity of asking if you
will accept the appointment? The salary annexed
thereto, and the prospects of lucrative practice in
this city [Philadelphia]&mdash;the present seat of the
Gen<sup>l&#803;</sup> Government, must be as well known to you,
perhaps better, than they are to me, and therefore
I shall say nothing concerning them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"If your answer is in the affirmative, it will readily
occur to you that no unnecessary time should be
lost in repairing to this place. If, on the contrary,
it should be the negative (which would give me concern)
it might be as well to say nothing of this offer.
But in either case, I pray you to give me an answer
as promptly as you can."<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Marshall decided instantly; he could not possibly
afford to accept a place yielding only fifteen hundred
dollars annually, the salary of the Attorney-General
at that period,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> and the duties of which permitted
little time for private practice which was then
allowable.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> So Marshall, in a "few minutes" declined
Washington's offer in a letter which is a model
of good taste.</p>

<p>"I had the honor of receiving a few minutes past
your letter of the 26th inst.</p>

<p>"While the business I have undertaken to complete
in Richmond,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> forbids me to change my situation
tho for one infinitely more eligible, permit me Sir to
express my sincere acknowledgments for the offer
your letter contains &amp; the real pride &amp; gratification
I feel at the favorable opinion it indicates.</p>

<p>"I respect too highly the offices of the present
government of the United States to permit it to be
suspected that I have declined one of them."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>
<p>When he refused the office of Attorney-General,
Washington, sorely perplexed, wrote Marshall's
brother-in-law,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Edward Carrington, United States
Marshal and Collector of Internal Revenue for the
District of Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> a letter, "the <i>whole</i>" of which
"is perfectly confidential, written, perhaps, with more
candor than prudence," concerning Innes or Henry
for the place; but, says the President, "having a
high opinion of General<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> Marshall's honor, prudence,
and judgment," Carrington must consult him.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>The harassed President had now come to lean
heavily on Marshall in Virginia affairs; indeed, it
may be said that he was Washington's political agent
at the State Capital. Carrington's answer is typical
of his reports to the President: "The inquiry [concerning
the selection of an Attorney-General] which
you have been pleased to submit to Gen<sup>l&#803;</sup> Marshall
and myself demands &amp; receives our most serious attention&mdash;On
his [Marshall's] aid I rely for giving
you accurate information."<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="480" height="612" alt="John Marshall by Rembrandt Peale" title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>John Marshall<br />
<small>From a painting by Rembrandt Peale</small></i></span>
</div>

<p>Later Carrington advises Washington that Marshall
"wishes an opportunity of conversing with
Col. Innes before he decides."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Innes was absent at
Williamsburg; and although the matter was urgent,
Marshall and Carrington did not write Innes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>because, to do so, would involve a decisive offer from
Washington which "Gen<sup>l&#803;</sup> Marshall does not think
advisable."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>When Washington's second letter, suggesting
Patrick Henry, was received by Carrington, he "immediately
consulted Gen<sup>l&#803;</sup> Marshall thereon"; and
was guided by his opinion. Marshall thought that
Washington's letter should be forwarded to Henry
because "his nonacceptance, from domestic considerations,
may be calculated on"; the offer "must
tend to soften" Henry "if he has any asperities";
and the whole affair would make Henry "active
on the side of Government &amp; order."<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>Marshall argued that, if Henry should accept,
his friendship for the Administration could be
counted on. But Marshall's strongest reason for
trying to induce Henry to become a member of the
Cabinet was, says Carrington, that "we are fully persuaded
that a more deadly blow could not be given
to the Faction [Republican party] in Virginia, &amp; perhaps
elsewhere, than that Gentleman's acceptance of
the" Attorney-Generalship. "So much have the opposers
of the Government held him [Henry] up as
their oracle, even since he has ceased to respond to
them, that any event demonstrating his active support
to Government, could not but give the [Republican]
party a severe shock."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>A week later Carrington reports that Henry's
"conduct &amp; sentiments generally both as to government
&amp; yourself [Washington] are such as we [Marshall
and Carrington] calculated on ... which assure
us of his discountenancing calumny of every description
&amp; disorder,"<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> meaning that Henry was hostile
to the Republicans.</p>

<p>In the rancorous assaults upon the Jay Treaty in
Virginia, Marshall, of course, promptly took his
position by Washington's side, and stoutly defended
the President and even the hated compact itself.
Little cared Marshall for the effect of his stand upon
his popularity. Not at all did he fear or hesitate
to take that stand. And high courage was required
to resist the almost universal denunciation of the
treaty in Virginia. Nor was this confined to the
masses of the people; it was expressed also by most
of the leading men in the various communities. At
every meeting of protest, well-drawn and apparently
convincing resolutions were adopted, and able, albeit
extravagant, speeches were made against the
treaty and the Administration.</p>

<p>Typical of these was the address of John Thompson
at Petersburg, August 1, 1795.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> With whom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
asked Thompson, was the treaty made? With the
British King "who had sworn eternal enmity to
republics"; that hateful monarch who was trying
"to stifle the liberty of France" and "to starve thirty
millions of men" by "intercepting the correspondence
and plundering the commerce of neutral nations,"
especially that of the United States. The
British, declared Thompson, sought "the destruction
of our rising commerce; the annihilation of our
growing navigation," and were pursuing that object
"with all the ... oppression which rapacity can
practice."</p>

<p>Sequestration of British debts and other justifiable
measures of retaliation would, said he, have
stopped Great Britain's lawless practices. But the
Administration preferred to treat with that malign
Power; and our envoy, Jay, instead of "preserving
the attitude of dignity and speaking the language
of truth ... basely apostatizing from republican
principles, stooped to offer the incense of flattery
to a tyrant, the scourge of his country, the foe of
mankind.... Yes!" exclaimed the radical orator,
"we hesitated to offend a proud King, who had captured
our vessels, enslaved our fellow-citizens, ruined
our merchants, invaded our territory and trampled
on our sovereignty." In spite of these wrongs and insults,
"we prostrated ourselves before him, smiled in
his face, flattered, and obtained this treaty."</p>

<p>The treaty thus negotiated was, declared Thompson,
the climax of the Funding system which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
"organized a great aristocracy ... usurped the
dominion of the senate ... often preponderated
in the house of representatives and which proclaims
itself in servile addresses to our supreme executive,
in dangerous appointments, in monstrous accumulations
of debt, in violation of the constitution, in
proscriptions of democrats, and, to complete the
climax of political infamy, in this treaty."</p>

<p>Concerning the refusal to observe the principle that
"free bottoms make free goods," our yielding the
point rendered us, avowed Thompson, "a cowardly
confederate ... of ... ruthless despots, who march
to desolate France, to restore the altars of barbarous
superstition and to extinguish the celestial light
which has burst upon the human mind. O my
countrymen, when you are capable of such monstrous
baseness, even the patriot will invoke upon you the
contempt of ages." This humiliation had been
thrust upon us as a natural result of Washington's
Neutrality proclamation&mdash;"a sullen neutrality between
freemen and despots."</p>

<p>Thompson's searching, if boyish, rhetoric truly
expressed the feeling in the hearts of the people; it
was a frenzied sentiment with which Marshall had
to contend. Notwithstanding his blazing language,
Thompson analyzed the treaty with ability. In common
with opponents of the treaty everywhere, he
laid strongest emphasis on its unconstitutionality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and the "usurpation" by the President and Senate of
the rights and powers of the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>But Thompson also mentioned one point that
touched Marshall closely. "The ninth article,"
said he, "invades the rights of this commonwealth,
by contemplating the case of Denny Fairfax."<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
Marshall and his brother were now the owners of
this estate;<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> and the Jay Treaty confirmed all transfers
of British property and authorized British subjects
to grant, sell, or devise lands held in America
in the same manner as if they were citizens of the
United States. In Congress a few months later,
Giles, who, declared Ames, "has no scruples and
certainly less sense,"<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> touched lightly on this same
chord.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> So did Heath, who was from that part of
Virginia lying within the Fairfax grant.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>Such was the public temper in Virginia, as accurately
if bombastically expressed by the youthful
Thompson, when the elections for the Legislature of
1795 were held. It was certain that the General Assembly
would take drastic and hostile action against
the treaty; and, perhaps, against Washington himself,
in case the Republicans secured a majority in
that body. The Federalists were in terror and justly
so; for the Republicans, their strength much increased
by the treaty, were aggressive and confident.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>The Federalist candidate in Richmond was the
member of the Legislature whom the Federalists had
succeeded in electing after Marshall's retirement
three years before. He was Marshall's intimate friend
and a stanch supporter of Washington's Administration.
But it appears that in the present crisis
his popularity was not sufficient to secure his election,
nor his courage robust enough for the stern
fight that was certain to develop in the General
Assembly.</p>

<p>The polls were open and the voting in progress.
Marshall was among the first to arrive; and he
announced his choice.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Upon his appearance "a
gentleman demanded that a poll be opened for
Mr. Marshall."<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Marshall, of course, indignantly
refused; he had promised to support his friend, he
avowed, and now to become a candidate was against
"his wishes and feeling and honor." But Marshall
promised that he would stand for the Legislature
the following year.</p>

<p>Thereupon Marshall left the polls and went to the
court-house to make an argument in a case then
pending. No sooner had he departed than a poll
was opened for him in spite of his objections;<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> he
was elected; and in the evening was told of the
undesired honor with which the freeholders of
Richmond had crowned him.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<p>Washington was apprehensive of the newly elected
Legislature. He anxiously questioned Carrington
"as to the temper of our Assembly." The latter
reported that he did not "expect an extravagant
conduct during the session."<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> He thought that
"the spirit of dissatisfaction is considerably abated
abroad" (throughout Virginia and away from Richmond),
because recent attempts to hold county and
district meetings "for the avowed purpose of condemning
the Administration &amp; the Treaty" had
been "abortive." It seemed to him, however, that
"there is a very general impression unfavorable to
the Treaty, owing to the greater industry of those
who revile, over the supporters of it."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>Still, Carrington was not sure about the Legislature
itself; for, as he said, "it has every year for several
past been observable, that, at meeting [of the
Legislature] but few hot heads were to be seen, while
the great body were rational; but in the course of
the session it has seldom happened otherwise than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
that the spirit of party has been communicated so
as to infect a majority. In the present instance I
verily believe a question put on this day [the first
day of the session] for making the Treaty a subject
of consideration would be negatived&mdash;yet sundry
members are here who will attempt every injury
to both the Administration &amp; the Treaty. The
party will want ability in their leaders.... General
Lee, C. Lee, Gen<sup>l&#803;</sup> Marshall &amp; Mr. Andrews will act
with ability on the defensive."<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>Three days later the buoyant official advised the
President that the Republicans doubted their own
strength and, at worst, would delay their attack
"in order that, as usual, a heat may be generated."
Marshall was still busy searching for a properly qualified
person to appoint to the unfilled vacancy in
the office of Attorney-General; and Carrington tells
Washington that "Gen<sup>l&#803;</sup> Marshall and myself have
had a private consultation" on that subject and had
decided to recommend Judge Blain. But, he adds,
"The suggestion rests entirely with Gen<sup>l&#803;</sup> M[arshall]
&amp; myself &amp; will there expire, should you, for any
consideration, forbear to adopt it." His real message
of joy, however, was the happy frame of mind of
the Legislature.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>Alas for this prophecy of optimism! The Legislature
had not been in session a week before the
anti-Administration Banquo's ghost showed its grim
visage. The Republicans offered a resolution approving
the vote of Virginia Senators against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Jay Treaty. For three days the debate raged.
Marshall led the Federalist forces. "The support of
the Treaty has fallen altogether on Gen<sup>l&#803;</sup> Marshall
and Mr. Chas. Lee," Carrington reports to Washington.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>Among the many objections to the treaty the
principal one, as we have seen, was that it violated
the Constitution. The treaty regulated commerce;
the Constitution gave that power to Congress,
which included the House of Representatives; yet
the House had not been consulted. The treaty
involved naturalization, the punishment of piracies,
the laying of imposts and the expenditure of money&mdash;all
of these subjects were expressly placed under
the control of Congress and one of them<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> (the
raising and expending of public money) must originate
in the House; yet that popular branch of the
Government had been ignored. The treaty provided
for a quasi-judicial commission to settle the question
of the British debts; yet "all the power of the Federal
government with respect to debts is given
[Congress] by a concise article of the Constitution.... What
article of the Constitution authorizes
President and Senate to establish a judiciary colossus
which is to stand with one foot on America and
the other on Britain, and drag the reluctant governments
of those countries to the altar of justice?"<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the question was raised whether a commercial
treaty, or an international compact requiring
an appropriation of money, or, indeed, any treaty
whatever in the execution of which any action of
any kind on the part of the House of Representatives
was necessary, could be made without the
concurrence of the House as well as the Senate.
On this, the only vital and enduring question involved,
Marshall's views were clear and unshakable.</p>

<p>The defense of the constitutional power of the
President and Senate to make treaties was placed
solely on Marshall's shoulders. The Federalists considered
his argument a conclusive demonstration.
Carrington wrote Washington that "on the point of
constitutionality many conversions were acknowledged."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
He was mistaken; the Republicans were
not impressed. On the contrary, they thought that
the treaty "was much less ably defended than opposed."<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans had been very much alarmed
over Marshall and especially feared the effect of one
clever move. "John Marshall," wrote Jefferson's
son-in-law from Richmond to the Republican commander
in Monticello, "it was once apprehended
would make a great number of converts by an argument
which cannot be considered in any other light
than an uncandid artifice. To prevent what would
be a virtual censure of the President's conduct he
maintained <i>that the treaty in all its commercial parts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
was still under the power of the H.</i>[ouse] <i>of R.</i>[epresentatives]."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>Marshall, indeed, did make the most of this
point. It was better, said he, and "more in the spirit
of the constitution" for the National House to refuse
support after ratification than to have a treaty "stifled
in embryo" by the House passing upon it before
ratification. "He compared the relation of the Executive
and the Legislative department to that between
the states and the Congress under the old confederation.
The old Congress might have given up
the right of laying discriminating duties in favor of
any nation by treaty; it would never have thought
of taking beforehand the assent of each state thereto.
Yet, no one would have pretended to deny the
power of the states to lay such [discriminating duties]."<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>Such is an unfriendly report of this part of Marshall's
effort which, wrote Jefferson's informant, "is
all that is original in his argument. The sophisms
of Camillus, &amp; the nice distinctions of the Examiner
made up the rest."<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Marshall's position was that a
"treaty is as completely a valid and obligatory contract
when negotiated by the President and ratified
by him, with the assent and advice of the Senate, as
if sanctioned by the House of Representatives also,
under a constitution requiring such sanction"; and
he admitted only that the powers of the House in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
reference to a treaty were limited to granting or refusing
appropriations to carry it into effect.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>But as a matter of practical tactics to get votes,
Marshall appears to have put this in the form of an
assertion&mdash;no matter what treaty the President and
Senate made, the House held the whip hand, he argued,
and in the end, could do what it liked; why
then unnecessarily affront and humiliate Washington
by applauding the Virginia Senators for their vote
against the treaty? This turn of Marshall's, thought
the Republicans, "was brought forward for the
purpose of gaining over the unwary &amp; wavering. It
has never been admitted by the writers in favor of
the treaty to the northward."<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>But neither Marshall's unanswerable argument
on the treaty-making power, nor his cleverness in
holding up the National House of Representatives as
the final arbiter, availed anything. The Federalists
offered an amendment affirming that the President
and Senate "have a right to make" a treaty; that
discussion of a treaty in a State Legislature, "except
as to its constitutionality," was unnecessary; and
that the Legislature could not give "any mature
opinion upon the conduct of the Senators from
Virginia ... without a full investigation of the
treaty." They were defeated by a majority of 46
out of a total of 150 members present and voting;
John Marshall voting for the amendment.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> On the
main resolution proposed by the Republicans the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Federalists lost two votes and were crushed by a
majority of two to one; Marshall, of course, voting
with the minority.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>Carrington hastily reported to Washington that
though "the discussion has been an able one on
the side of the Treaty," yet, "such was the apprehension
that a vote in its favor would be unpopular,
that argument was lost"; and that, notwithstanding
many members were convinced by Marshall's constitutional
argument, "obligations of expediency"
held them in line against the Administration. The
sanguine Carrington assured the President, however,
that "during the discussion there has been
preserved a decided respect for &amp; confidence in
you."<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>But alas again for the expectations of sanguinity!
The Republican resolution was, as Jefferson's son-in-law
had reported to the Republican headquarters
at Monticello, "a virtual censure of the President's
conduct." This was the situation at the close of the
day's debate. Realizing it, as the night wore on,
Washington's friends determined to relieve the
President of this implied rebuke by the Legislature
of his own State. The Republicans had carried their
point; and surely, thought Washington's supporters,
the Legislature of Virginia would not openly affront
the greatest of all Americans, the pride of the State,
and the President of the Nation.</p>

<p>Infatuated imagination! The next morning the
friends of the Administration offered a resolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
that Washington's "motives" in approving the
treaty met "the entire approbation of this House";
and that Washington, "for his great abilities, <i>wisdom</i>
and integrity merits and possesses the undiminished
confidence of his country." The resolution
came near passing. But some lynx-eyed Republican
discovered in the nick of time the word "<i>wisdom</i>."<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
That would never do. The Republicans, therefore,
offered an amendment "that this House do entertain
the highest sense of the integrity and patriotism
of the President of the United States; and that
while they approve of the vote of the Senators of
this State" on the treaty, "they in no wise censure
the motives which influenced him in his [Washington's]
conduct thereupon."<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>The word "wisdom" was carefully left out. Marshall,
Lee, and the other Federalists struggled hard
to defeat this obnoxious amendment; but the Republicans
overwhelmed them by a majority of 33
out of a total of 145 voting, Marshall, of course,
casting his vote against it.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>In worse plight than ever, Washington's friends
moved to amend the Republican amendment by resolving:
"That the President of the United States,
for his great abilities, <i>wisdom</i>, and integrity, merits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and possesses the undiminished confidence of this
House." But even this, which omitted all reference
to the treaty and merely expressed confidence in
Washington's "abilities, wisdom, and integrity,"
was beaten by a majority of 20 out of a total of
138 voting.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>As soon as Jefferson got word of Marshall's support
of Washington's Administration in the Legislature,
he poured out his dislike which had long been
distilling:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Though Marshall will be able to embarras [<i>sic</i>]
the republican party in the assembly a good deal,"
wrote Jefferson to Madison, "yet upon the whole
his having gone into it will be of service. He has
been, hitherto, able to do more mischief acting
under the mask of Republicanism than he will be
able to do after throwing it plainly off. His lax
lounging manners have made him popular with the
bulk of the people of Richmond; &amp; a profound
hypocrisy, with many thinking men of our country.
But having come forth in the plenitude of his English
principles the latter will see that it is high time
to make him known."<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Such was Jefferson's inability to brook any opposition,
and his readiness to ascribe improper motives
to any one having views different from his own. So
far from Marshall's having cloaked his opinions, he
had been and was imprudently outspoken in avowing
them. Frankness was as much a part of Marshall's
mental make-up as his "lax, lounging manners"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
were a part of his physical characteristics. Of all
the men of the period, not one was cleaner of hypocrisy
than he. From Patrick Henry in his early life
onward to his associates on the bench at the end
of his days the testimony as to Marshall's open-mindedness
is uniform and unbroken.</p>

<p>With the possible exception of Giles and Roane,
Jefferson appears to have been the only man who
even so much as hinted at hypocrisy in Marshall.
Although strongly opposing his views and suggesting
the influence of supposed business connections,
Madison had supreme confidence in Marshall's integrity
of mind and character. So had Monroe.
Even Jefferson's most panegyrical biographer declares
Marshall to have been "an earnest and sincere
man."<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>The House of Delegates having refused to approve
Washington, even indirectly, the matter went to
the State Senate. There for a week Washington's
friends fought hard and made a slight gain. The
Senate struck out the House resolution and inserted
instead: "The General Assembly entertain the highest
sense of the integrity, patriotism and wisdom of
the President of the United States, and in approving
the vote of the Senators of the State in the Congress
of the United States, relative to the treaty with
Great Britain, they in no wise mean to censure the
motives which influenced him in his conduct thereupon."
To this the House agreed, although by a
slender majority, Marshall, of course, voting for
the Senate amendment.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>During this session Marshall was, as usual, on the
principal standing committees and did his accustomed
share of general legislative work. He was
made chairman of a special committee to bring in
a bill "authorizing one or more branches of the bank
of the United States in this commonwealth";<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> and
later presented the bill,<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> which finally passed, December
8, 1795, though not without resistance, 38 votes
being cast against it.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>But the Republicans had not yet finished with the
Jay Treaty or with its author. On December 12,
1795, they offered a resolution instructing Virginia's
Senators and Representatives in Congress to attempt
to secure amendments to the Constitution providing
that: "Treaties containing stipulations upon
the subject of powers vested in Congress shall be
approved by the House of Representatives"; that
"a tribunal other than the Senate be instituted for
trying impeachments"; that "Senators shall be
chosen for three years"; and that "U.S. Judges
shall hold no other appointments."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>The Federalists moved to postpone this resolution
until the following year "and print and distribute
proposed amendments for the consideration
of the people"; but they were beaten by a majority
of 11 out of a total vote of 129, Marshall voting for
the resolution. The instruction to secure these radical
constitutional changes then passed the House by
a majority of 56 out of a total vote of 120, Marshall
voting against it.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall's brother-in-law, United States Marshal
Carrington, had a hard time explaining to Washington
his previous enthusiasm. He writes: "The active
powers of the [Republican] party ... unveiled themselves,
&amp; carried in the House some points very extraordinary
indeed, manifesting disrespect towards
you." But, he continues, when the Virginia Senate
reversed the House, "the zealots of Anarchy were
backward to act ... while the friends of Order were
satisfied to let it [the Virginia Senate amendment]
remain for farther effects of reflection"; and later
succeeded in carrying it.</p>

<p>"The fever has raged, come to its crisis, and is
abating." Proof of this, argued Carrington, was
the failure of the Republicans to get signatures to
"some seditious petitions [against the Jay Treaty]
which was sent in vast numbers from Philadelphia"
and which "were at first patronized with great zeal
by many of our distinguished anarchists; but ...
very few copies will be sent to Congress fully
signed."<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>Never was appointive officer so oblivious of facts
in his reports to his superior, as was Carrington.
Before adjournment on December 12, 1795, the Legislature
adopted part of the resolution which had
been offered in the morning: "No treaty containing
any stipulation upon the subject of powers vested
in Congress by the eighth section of the first article
[of the Constitution] shall become the Supreme law
of the land until it shall have been approved in
those particulars by a majority in the House of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Representatives; and that the President, before he
shall ratify <i>any</i> treaty, shall submit the same to
the House of Representatives."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>Carrington ignored or failed to understand this
amazing resolution of the Legislature of Virginia;
for nearly three months later he again sought to
solace Washington by encouraging reports. "The
public mind in Virginia was never more tranquil than
at present. The fever of the late session of our assembly,
had not been communicated to the Country....
The people do not approve of the violent
and petulant measures of the Assembly, because, in
several instances, public meetings have declared a
decided disapprobation." In fact, wrote Carrington,
Virginia's "hostility to the treaty has been exaggerated."
Proof "of the mass of the people being
less violent than was asserted" would be discovered
"in the failure of our Zealots in getting their signatures
to certain printed papers, sent through the
Country almost by Horse loads, as copies of a petition
to Congress on the subject of the Treaty."<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
But a few short months would show how rose-colored
were the spectacles which Mr. Carrington wore
when he wrote this reassuring letter.</p>

<p>The ratification of the British treaty; the rage
against England; and the devotion to France which
already had made the Republican a French party;
the resentment of the tri-color Republic toward the
American Government&mdash;all forged a new and desperate
menace. It was, indeed, Scylla or Charybdis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
as Washington had foreseen, and bluntly stated, that
confronted the National Government. War with
France now seemed the rock on which events were
driving the hard-pressed Administration&mdash;war for
France or war from France.</p>

<p>The partisan and simple-minded Monroe had been
recalled from his diplomatic post at Paris. The
French mission, which at the close of our Revolution
was not a place of serious moment,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> now became
critically&mdash;vitally&mdash;important. Level must
be the head and stout the heart of him who should
be sent to deal with that sensitive, proud, and now
violent country. Lee thus advises the President:
"No person would be better fitted than John Marshall
to go to France for supplying the place of our
minister; but it is scarcely short of absolute certainty
that he would not accept any such office."<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>But Washington's letter was already on the way,
asking Marshall to undertake this delicate task:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In confidence I inform you," wrote Washington
to Marshall, "that it has become indispensably necessary
to recall our minister at Paris &amp; to send one
in his place, who will explain faithfully the views of
this government &amp; ascertain those of France.</p>

<p>"Nothing would be more pleasing to me than that
you should be this organ, if it were only for a temporary
absence of a few months; but it being feared
that even this could not be made to comport with
your present pursuits, I have in order that as little
delay as possible may be incurred put the enclosed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
letter [to Charles Cotesworth Pinckney] under cover
to be forwarded to its address, if you decline the
present offer or to be returned to me if you accept
it. Your own correct knowledge of circumstances
renders details unnecessary."<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>Marshall at once declined this now high distinction
and weighty service, as he had already refused
the United States district attorneyship and a place
in Washington's Cabinet. Without a moment's delay,
he wrote the President:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will not attempt to express those sensations
which your letter of the 8th instant has increased.
Was it possible for me in the present crisis of my affairs
to leave the United States, such is my conviction
of the importance of that duty which you would
confide to me, &amp;, pardon me if I add, of the fidelity
with which I shoud attempt to perform it, that
I woud certainly forego any consideration not decisive
with respect to my future fortunes, &amp; woud
surmount that just diffidence I have entertain<sup>d</sup> of
myself, to make one effort to convey truly &amp; faithfully
to the government of France those sentiments
which I have ever believed to be entertained by that
of the United States.</p>

<p>"I have forwarded your letter to Mr. Pinckney.
The recall of our minister at Paris has been conjectured
while its probable necessity has been regretted
by those who love more than all others, our own
country. I will certainly do myself the honor of
waiting on you at Mt. Vernon."<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Washington, although anticipating Marshall's
refusal of the French mission, promptly answered:
"I ... regret that present circumstances should deprive
our Country of the services, which, I am
confident, your going to France would have rendered
it"; and Washington asks Marshall's opinion
on the proper person to appoint to the office of
Surveyor-General.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>The President's letter, offering the French post to
Pinckney, was lost in the mails; and the President
wrote Marshall about it, because it also enclosed a
note "containing three bank bills for one hundred
dollars each for the sufferers by fire in Charlestown."<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
In answer, Marshall indulged in a flash of humor,
even at Washington's expense. "Your letter to
General Pinckney was delivered by myself to the
post master on the night on which I received it and
was, as he says, immediately forwarded by him.
Its loss is the more remarkable, as it could not have
been opened from a hope that it contained bank
notes." He also expressed his gratification "that
a gentleman of General Pinckney's character will
represent our government at the court of France."<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>The office of Secretary of State now became vacant,
under circumstances apparently forbidding.
The interception of Fauchet's<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> famous dispatch
number 10<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> had been fatal to Randolph. The French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Minister, in this communication to his Government,
portrays a frightful state of corrupt public thinking
in America; ascribes this to the measures of Washington's
Administration; avows that a revolution is
imminent; declares that powerful men, "all having
without doubt" Randolph at their head, are balancing
to decide on their party; asserts that Randolph
approached him with suggestions for money; and
concludes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thus with some thousands of dollars the [French]
republic could have decided on civil war or on peace
[in America]! Thus the consciences of the pretended
patriots of America have already their prices!...
What will be the old age of this [American] government,
if it is thus early decrepid!"<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>The discovery of this dispatch of the French
Minister destroyed Randolph politically. Washington
immediately forced his resignation.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>The President had great difficulty in finding a suitable
successor to the deposed Secretary of State. He
tendered the office to five men, all of whom declined.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
"What am I to do for a Secretary of State?" he asks
Hamilton; and after recounting his fruitless efforts
to fill that office the President adds that "Mr. Marshall,
of Virginia, has declined the office of Attorney
General, and I am pretty certain, would accept of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
no other."<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> It is thus made clear that Washington
would have made Marshall the head of his Cabinet
in 1795 but for the certainty that his Virginia
champion would refuse the place, as he had declined
other posts of honor and power.</p>

<p>Hardly had the Virginia Legislature adjourned
when the conflict over the treaty was renewed in
Congress. The Republicans had captured the House
of Representatives and were full of fight. They
worked the mechanism of public meetings and petitions
to its utmost. On March 7 the House plunged
into a swirl of debate over the British treaty; time
and again it seemed as though the House would
strangle the compact by withholding appropriations
to make it effective.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> If the treaty was to be
saved, all possible pressure must be brought to
bear on Congress. So the Federalists took a leaf
out of the book of Republican tactics, and got up
meetings wherever they could to petition Congress
to grant the necessary money.</p>

<p>In Virginia, as elsewhere, the merchants were the
principal force in arranging these meetings.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> As
we have seen, the business and financial interests
had from the first been the stanchest supporters
of Washington's Administration. "The commercial
and monied people are zealously attached to" and
support the Government, wrote Wolcott in 1791.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
And now Hamilton advised King that "men of busi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>ness
of all descriptions" thought the defeat of the
treaty "would greatly shock and stagnate pecuniary
plans and operations in general."<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Indeed, the one
virtue of the treaty, aside from its greatest purpose,
that of avoiding war, was that it prevented the collapse
of credit and the wreck of Hamilton's financial
system.</p>

<p>Washington, with the deceptive hopefulness of
responsibility, had, even when it seemed that the
people were as one man against the treaty, "doubted
much whether the great body of the yeomanry
have formed any opinions on the subject."<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> The
Federalist meetings were designed to show that
the "yeomanry," having been "educated," had at
last made up its mind in favor of Washington's
policy.</p>

<p>Marshall and Carrington arranged for the Richmond
gathering. "The disorganizing machinations of
a faction [Republicans]," reported the busy United
States Marshal, "are no longer left to be nourished
and inculcated on the minds of the credulous by
clamorous demagogues, while the great mass of
citizens, viewing these, as evils at a distance, remain
inactive.... All who are attached to peace
and order, ... will now come forward and speak for
themselves.... A meeting of the people of this city
will take place on Monday next" to petition the
National House of Representatives to support the
treaty. So Carrington advised the President; and
the same thing, said he, was to be done "exten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>sively"
by "public meetings and Petitions throughout
Virginia."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>Washington was expecting great results from the
Richmond demonstration. "It would give me and ... every friend to order and good government
throughout the United States very great satisfaction,"
he wrote to encourage the Virginia Federalists;
"more so than similar sentiments from any
other State in the Union; for people living at a distance
from it [Virginia] know not how to believe
it possible" that the Virginia Legislature and her
Senators and Representatives in Congress should
speak and act as they had done.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> "It is," philosophized
Washington, "on <i>great</i> occasions <i>only</i> and
after time has been given for cool and deliberate
reflection that the <i>real</i> voice of the people can be
known. The present ... is one of those great
occasions, than which none more important has
occurred, or probably may occur again to call forth
their decision."<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>By such inspiration and management the historic
Federalist gathering was brought about at Richmond
on April 25, 1796, where the "Marshall eloquence"
was to do its utmost to convert a riotously
hostile sentiment into approval of this famous
treaty and of the Administration which was responsible
for it. All day the meeting lasted. Marshall
put forth his whole strength. At last a "decided
majority" adopted a favorable resolution drawn by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
an "original opponent" of the treaty. Thus were
sweetened the bitter resolutions adopted by these
same freeholders of Richmond some months before,
which had so angered Washington.</p>

<p>The accounts of this all-day public discussion
are as opposite as were the prejudices and interests
of the narrators. Justice Story tells us that Marshall's
speech was "masterly," the majority for the
resolution "flattering," and the assemblage itself
made up of the "same citizens" who formerly had
"denounced" the treaty.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> But there was present at
the meeting an onlooker who gives a different version.
Randolph, who, in disgrace, was then sweating
venom from every pore, thus reports to Madison
at the end of the hard-fought day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Between 3 &amp; 400 persons were present; a large
proportion of whom were British merchants, some
of whom pay for the British purchases of horses&mdash;their
clerks&mdash;officers, who have held posts under
the President at his will,&mdash;stockholders&mdash;expectants
of office&mdash;and many without the shadow of
a freehold.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Notwithstanding this, the numbers on
the republican side, tho' inferior, were inferior in a
small degree only; and it is believed on good grounds
that the majority of free-holders were on the side
of the house of representatives [against the treaty].</p>

<p>"Campbell<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> and Marshall the principal combatants
[word illegible] as you know without being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
told. Marshall's argument was inconsistent, and
shifting; concluding every third sentence with the
horrors of war. Campbell spoke elegantly and
forcibly; and threw ridicule and absurdity upon his
antagonist with success. Mr. Clofton [Clopton, member
of Congress from Richmond] will receive two
papers; one signed by the treaty men, many of
whom he will know to have neither interest nor feeling
in common with the citizens of Virginia, and
to have been transplanted hither from England or
Caledonia since the war, interspersed pretty considerably
with fugitive tories who have returned under
the amnesty of peace.</p>

<p>"The notice, which I sent you the other day,"
he goes on to say, "spoke of instructions and a
petition; but Marshall, suspecting that he would be
outnumbered by freeholders, and conscious that
none should instruct those who elect, quitted the
idea of instruction, and betook himself to a petition,
in which he said all the inhabitants of Richmond,
though not freeholders, might join. Upon which
Campbell gave notice, that it would be published
that he (Marshall) declined hazarding the question
on the true sense of the country. Very few of
the people [freeholders] of the county were present;
but three-fourths of those who were present voted
with Campbell. Dr. Foushee was extremely active
and influential."<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>Marshall, on the contrary, painted in rich colors
his picture of this town-hall contest. He thus reports<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
to Hamilton: "I had been informed of the temper
of the House of Representatives and we [Richmond
Federalists] had promptly taken such measures
as appeared to us fitted to the occasion. We could
not venture an expression of the public mind under
the violent prejudices with which it has been impressed,
so long as a hope remained, that the House
of Representatives might ultimately consult the
interest or honor of the nation.... But now, when
all hope of this has vanished, it was deemed advisable
to make the experiment, however hazardous
it might be.</p>

<p>"A meeting was called," continues Marshall,
"which was more numerous than I have ever seen
at this place; and after a very ardent and zealous discussion
which consumed the day, a decided majority
declared in favor of a resolution that the wellfare
and honor of the nation required us to give full
effect to the treaty negotiated with Britain. This
resolution, with a petition drawn by an original opponent
of the treaty, will be forwarded by the next
post to Congress."<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>The resolution which Marshall's speech caused an
"original opponent"<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> of the treaty to draw was
"that the Peace, Happiness, &amp; Wellfare, not less
than the National Honor of the United States, depend
in a great degree upon giving, with good faith,
Full effect to the Treaty lately negotiated with
Great Britain." The same newspaper that printed
this resolution, in another account of the meeting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
"which was held at the instance of some friends of
the British Treaty," says that "in opposition to
that resolution a vast number of the meeting" subscribed
to counter-declarations which "are now
circulated throughout this City and the county of
Henrico for the subscription of all those who" are
opposed to the treaty.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Even the exultant Carrington
reported "that the enemies of the Treaty or
rather of the Government, are putting in practice
every part and effort to obtain subscriptions to a
counteracting paper."</p>

<p>Carrington denounced the unfavorable newspaper
account as "a most absolute falsehood." He tells
Washington that the opposition resolution "was not
even listened [to] in the meeting." But still he is
very apprehensive&mdash;he beholds the politician's
customary "crisis" and strives to make the people
see it: "There never was a crisis at which the
activity of the Friends of Government was more
urgently called for&mdash;some of us here have endeavored
to make this impression in different parts
of the Country."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The newspaper reported that
the Federalists had induced "school boys &amp; apprentices"
to sign the petition in favor of the treaty;
Carrington adds a postscript stating that this was,
"I believe, a little incorrect."</p>

<p>Marshall foresaw that the Republicans would
make this accusation and hastened to anticipate it
by advancing the same charge against his opponents.
The Republicans, says Marshall, secured the signa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>tures
to their petition not only "of many respectable
persons but of still a greater number of mere
boys.... Altho' some caution has been used by us
in excluding those who might not be considered as
authorized to vote," yet, Marshall advises King,
"they [Republicans] will not fail to charge us with
having collected a number of names belonging to
foreigners and to persons having no property in
the place. The charge is as far untrue," asserts
Marshall, "as has perhaps ever happened on any
occasion of the sort. We could, by resorting to
that measure, have doubled our list of petitioners."
And he adds that "the ruling party [Republican]
of Virginia are extremely irritated at the
vote of to-day, and will spare no exertion to
obtain a majority in other counties. Even here
they will affect to have the greater number of
freeholders."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>It was in this wise that petitions favorable to the
Jay Treaty and to Washington were procured in
the President's own State. It was thus that the remainder
of the country was assured that the Administration
was not without support among the
people of Virginia. Unsuspected and wholly unforeseen
was the influence on Marshall's future which
his ardent championship of this despised treaty was
to exercise.</p>

<p>The Federalists were wise to follow the Republican
practice of petition to Congress; for, "nothing ... but
the torrent of petitions and remonstrances ... would
have produced a division (fifty-one to forty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>-eight)
in favor of the appropriation."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> So great was
the joy of the commercial classes that in Philadelphia,
the financial heart of the country, a holiday
was celebrated when the House voted the money.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's activity, skill, courage, ability, and
determination in the Legislature and before the
people at this critical hour lifted him higher than
ever, not only in the regard of Washington, but in
the opinion of the Federalist leaders throughout
the country.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> They were casting about for a
successor to Washington who could be most easily
elected. The Hamiltonian Federalists were already
distrustful of Adams for the presidency, and, even
then, were warily searching for some other candidate.
Why not Patrick Henry? Great changes had
occurred in the old patriot's mind and manner of
thinking. He was now a man of wealth and had
come to lean strongly toward the Government. His
friendship for Washington, Marshall, and other Virginia
Federalists had grown; while for Jefferson and
other Virginia Republicans it had turned to dislike.
Still, with Henry's lifelong record, the Federalists
could not be sure of him.</p>

<p>To Marshall's cautious hands the Federalist leaders
committed the delicate business of sounding
Henry. King of New York had written Marshall on
the subject. "Having never been in habits of correspondence
with Mr. H.[enry]," replies Marshall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
"I cou'd not by letter ask from him a decision on the
proposition I was requested to make him without
giving him at the same time a full statement of the
whole conversation &amp; of the persons with whom that
conversation was held." Marshall did not think
this wise, for "I am not positively certain what
course that Gentleman might take. The proposition
might not only have been rejected but mentioned
publickly to others in such manner as to have
become an unpleasant circumstance."</p>

<p>A prudent man was Marshall. He thought that
Lee, who "corresponds familiarly with Mr. H. &amp; is
in the habit of proposing offices to him," was the
man to do the work; and he asked Lee "to sound Mr.
H. as from himself or in such manner as might in any
event be perfectly safe." Lee did so, but got no
answer. However, writes Marshall, "Mr. H.[enry]
will be in Richmond on the 22<sup>d</sup> of May. I can then
sound him myself &amp; if I find him (as I suspect I
shall) totally unwilling to engage in the contest, I
can stop where prudence may direct. I trust it will
not then be too late to bring forward to public view
Mr. H. or any other gentleman who may be thought
of in his stead. Shou'd anything occur to render it
improper to have any communication with M<sup>r&#803;</sup> H. on
this subject, or shou'd you wish the communication
to take any particular shape you will be so obliging
as to drop me a line concerning it."<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall finally saw Henry and at once wrote the
New York lieutenant of Hamilton the result of the
interview. "Mr. Henry has at length been sounded
on the subject you communicated to my charge,"
Marshall advises King. "Gen<sup>l&#803;</sup> Lee and myself have
each conversed with him on it, tho' without informing
him particularly of the persons who authorized
the communication. He is unwilling to embark in
the business. His unwillingness, I think, proceeds
from an apprehension of the difficulties to be encountered
by those who shall fill high Executive
offices."<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>The autumn of 1796 was at hand. Washington's
second term was closing in Republican cloudbursts
and downpours of abuse of him. He was, said the
Republicans, an aristocrat, a "monocrat," a miser,
an oppressor of the many for the enrichment of the
few. Nay, more! Washington was a thief, even a
murderer, charged the Republicans. His personal
habits were low and base, said these champions
of purity.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Washington had not even been true
to the cause of the Revolution, they declared;
and to prove this, an ancient slander, supported
by forged letters alleged to have been written by
Washington during the war, was revived.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>Marshall, outraged and insulted by these assaults
on the great American, the friend of his father and
himself and the commander of the patriots who had,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
by arms, won liberty and independence for the very
men who were now befouling Washington's name,
earnestly defended the President. Although his
law practice and private business called for all his
strength and time, Marshall, in order to serve the
President more effectively, again stood for the Legislature,
and again he was elected.</p>

<p>In the Virginia House of Delegates, Marshall and
the other friends of Washington took the initiative.
On November 17, 1796, they carried a motion for an
address to the President, declaratory of Virginia's
"gratitude for the services of their most excellent
fellow citizen"; who "has so wisely and prosperously
administrated the national concerns."<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> But
how should the address be worded? The Republicans
controlled the committee to which the resolution
was referred. Two days later that body reported
a cold and formal collection of sentences as Virginia's
address to Washington upon his leaving, apparently
forever, the service of America. Even Lee,
who headed the committee, could not secure a declaration
that Washington was or had been wise.</p>

<p>This stiff "address" to Washington, reported by
the committee, left out the word "wisdom." Commendation
of Washington's conduct of the Government
was carefully omitted. Should his friends submit
to this? No! Better to be beaten in a manly
contest. Marshall and the other supporters of the
President resolved to try for a warmer expression.
On December 10, they introduced a substitute
declaring that, if Washington had not declined, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>people would have re&euml;lected him; that his whole life
had been "strongly marked by wisdom, valor, and
patriotism"; that "posterity to the most remote
generations and the friends of true and genuine
liberty and of the rights of man throughout the
world, and in all succeeding ages, will unite" in acclaiming
"that you have never ceased to deserve
well of your country"; that Washington's "valor
and wisdom ... had essentially contributed to establish
and maintain the happiness and prosperity
of the nation."<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>But the Republicans would have none of it. After
an acrid debate and in spite of personal appeals made
to the members of the House, the substitute was defeated
by a majority of three votes. John Marshall
was the busiest and most persistent of Washington's
friends, and of course voted for the substitute,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
which, almost certainly, he drew. Cold as was the
original address which the Federalists had failed to
amend, the Republicans now made it still more
frigid. They would not admit that Washington deserved
well of the whole country. They moved to
strike out the word "country" and in lieu thereof
insert "native state."<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>Many years afterward Marshall told Justice Story
his recollection of this bitter fight: "In the session
of 1796 ... which," said Marshall, "called forth all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the strength and violence of party, some Federalist
moved a resolution expressing the high confidence of
the House in the virtue, patriotism, and wisdom of
the President of the United States. A motion was
made to strike out the word <i>wisdom</i>. In the debate
the whole course of the Administration was reviewed,
and the whole talent of each party was brought into
action. Will it be believed that the word was retained
by a very small majority? A very small majority
in the legislature of Virginia acknowledged the
wisdom of General Washington!"<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Dazed for a moment, the Federalists did not resist.
But, their courage quickly returning, they
moved a brief amendment of twenty words declaring
that Washington's life had been "strongly
marked by wisdom, in the cabinet, by valor, in the
field, and by the purest patriotism in both." Futile
effort! The Republicans would not yield. By a majority
of nine votes<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> they flatly declined to declare
that Washington had been wise in council, brave in
battle, or patriotic in either; and the original address,
which, by these repeated refusals to endorse
either Washington's sagacity, patriotism, or even
courage, had now been made a dagger of ice, was sent
to Washington as the final comment of his native<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
State upon his lifetime of unbearable suffering and
incalculable service to the Nation.</p>

<p>Arctic as was this sentiment of the Virginia Republicans
for Washington, it was tropical compared
with the feeling of the Republican Party toward the
old hero as he retired from the Presidency. On Monday,
March 5, 1797, the day after Washington's
second term expired, the principal Republican
newspaper of America thus expressed the popular
sentiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation,' was
the pious ejaculation of a man who beheld a flood of
happiness rushing in upon mankind....</p>

<p>"If ever there was a time that would license the
reiteration of the exclamation, that time is now arrived,
for the man [Washington] who is the source
of all the misfortunes of our country, is this day reduced
to a level with his fellow citizens, and is no
longer possessed of power to multiply evils upon the
United States.</p>

<p>"If ever there was a period for rejoicing this is the
moment&mdash;every heart, in unison with the freedom
and happiness of the people ought to beat high with
exultation, that the name of Washington from this
day ceases to give a currency to political iniquity,
and to legalize corruption....</p>

<p>"A new &aelig;ra is now opening upon us, an &aelig;ra which
promises much to the people; for public measures
must now stand upon their own merits, and nefarious
projects can no longer be supported by a name.</p>

<p>"When a retrospect is taken of the Washingtonian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
administration for eight years, it is a subject of
the greatest astonishment, that a single individual
should have cankered the principles of republicanism
in an enlightened people, just emerged from the
gulph of despotism, and should have carried his designs
against the public liberty so far as to have put
in jeopardy its very existence.</p>

<p>"Such however are the facts, and with these staring
us in the face, this day ought to be a <span class="smcap">Jubilee</span>
in the United States."<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>Such was Washington's greeting from a great body
of his fellow citizens when he resumed his private
station among them after almost twenty years of
labor for them in both war and peace. Here rational
imagination must supply what record does not reveal.
What must Marshall have thought? Was this
the fruit of such sacrifice for the people's welfare as no
other man in America and few in any land throughout
all history had ever made&mdash;this rebuke of
Washington&mdash;Washington, who had been the soul
as well as the sword of the Revolution; Washington,
who alone had saved the land from anarchy; Washington,
whose level sense, far-seeing vision, and
mighty character had so guided the newborn Government
that the American people had taken their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
place as a separate and independent Nation? Could
any but this question have been asked by Marshall?</p>

<p>He was not the only man to whom such reflections
came. Patrick Henry thus expressed his feelings:
"I see with concern our old commander-in-chief
most abusively treated&mdash;nor are his long and
great services remembered.... If he, whose character
as our leader during the whole war, was above
all praise, is so roughly handled in his old age, what
may be expected by men of the common standard
of character?"<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>And Jefferson! Had he not become the voice of
the majority?</p>

<p>Great as he was, restrained as he had arduously
schooled himself to be, Washington personally resented
the brutal assaults upon his character with
something of the fury of his unbridled youth: "I had
no conception that parties would or even could go to
the length I have been witness to; nor did I believe,
until lately, that it was within the bounds of probability&mdash;hardly
within those of possibility&mdash;that ... every act of my administration would be tortured
and the grossest and most insidious misrepresentations
of them be made ... and that too in such
exaggerated and indecent terms as could scarcely
be applied to a Nero&mdash;a notorious defaulter&mdash;or
even to a common pickpocket."<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, then, once more, we clearly trace the development
of that antipathy between Marshall and
Jefferson, the seeds of which were sown in those
desolating years from 1776 to 1780, and in the not
less trying period from the close of the Revolution
to the end of Washington's Administration. Thus
does circumstance mould opinion and career far
more than abstract thinking; and emotion quite as
much as reason shape systems of government. The
personal feud between Marshall and Jefferson,
growing through the years and nourished by events,
gave force and speed to their progress along highways
which, starting at the same point, gradually
diverged and finally ran in opposite directions.</p>

the young Republican Party and suggests the economic line dividing
it from the Federalists. "In the present crisis Mr. H.[enry] may reasonably
be calculated on as taking the side of Government, even though
he may retain his old prejudices against the Constitution. He has
indubitably an abhorrence of Anarchy.... We know too that he is
improving his fortune fast, which must additionally attach him to
the existing Government &amp; order, the only Guarantees of property.
Add to all this, that he has no affection for the present leaders of the
opposition in Virg<sup>a</sup>." (Carrington to Washington, Oct. 13, 1795;

Marshall's judgment and that Marshall himself personally handled
most of the negotiations. (See <i>ib.</i>, Oct. 28; Oct. 30, 1795.)</p></div>

optimistic inaccuracy. They are typical of those which faithful office-holding
politicians habitually make to the appointing power. For instance,
Carrington told Washington in 1791 that, after traveling all
over Virginia as United States Marshal and Collector of Internal
Revenue, he was sure the people were content with Assumption and
the whiskey tax (Washington's <i>Diary</i>: Lossing, footnote to 166), when,
as a matter of fact, the State was boiling with opposition to those
very measures.</p></div>

unfriendliness to France, and the Federalist Party is illustrated
in a toast at a dinner in Lexington, Virginia, to Senator
Brown, who had voted against the treaty: "The French Republic&mdash;May
every power or party who would attempt to throw any
obstacle in the way of its independence or happiness receive the
reward due to corruption." (<i>Richmond and Manchester Advertiser</i>,

against including the word "wisdom" in the resolutions; and on the

(See Cobbett, i, 411; and <i>ib.</i>, 444, where the <i>Aurora</i> is represented

escape. In the debate over the last address of the National Legislature
to the President, Giles of Virginia declared that Washington had
been "neither wise nor firm." He did not think "so much of the President."
He "wished him to retire ... the government of the United
States could go on very well without him." (<i>Annals</i>, 4th Cong.,
2d Sess. (Dec. 14, 1796), 1614-18.) On the three roll-calls and passage
of the address Giles voted against Washington. (<i>Ib.</i>, 1666-68.) So
did Andrew Jackson, a new member from Tennessee. (<i>Ib.</i>)
</p><p>
The unpopularity of Washington's Administration led to the hostile
policy of Bache's paper, largely as a matter of business. This
provident editor became fiercely "Republican" because, as he explained
to his relative, Temple Franklin, in England, he "could not
[otherwise] maintain his family," and "he had determined to adopt a
bold experiment and to come out openly against the Administration.
He thought the public temper would bear it." (Marshall to Pickering,
Feb. 28, 1811, relating the statement of Temple Franklin to
James M. Marshall while in England in 1793.)</p></div>

<h3>THE MAN AND THE LAWYER</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Tall, meagre, emaciated, his muscles relaxed, his joints loosely connected,
his head small, his complexion swarthy, his countenance expressing great good
humor and hilarity. (William Wirt.)</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall can hardly be regarded as a learned lawyer. (Gustavus
Schmidt.)</p>

<p>His head is one of the best organized of any I have known. (Rufus King.)</p></div>


<p>On a pleasant summer morning when the cherries
were ripe, a tall, ungainly man in early middle life
sauntered along a Richmond street. His long legs
were encased in knee breeches, stockings, and shoes
of the period; and about his gaunt, bony frame hung
a roundabout or short linen jacket. Plainly, he had
paid little attention to his attire. He was bareheaded
and his unkempt hair was tied behind in a queue.
He carried his hat under his arm, and it was full of
cherries which the owner was eating as he sauntered
idly along.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Mr. Epps's hotel (The Eagle) faced the
street along which this negligently appareled person
was making his leisurely way. He greeted the landlord
as he approached, cracked a joke in passing, and
rambled on in his unhurried walk.</p>

<p>At the inn was an old gentleman from the country
who had come to Richmond where a lawsuit, to which
he was a party, was to be tried. The venerable litigant
had a hundred dollars to pay to the lawyer who
should conduct the case, a very large fee for those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
days. Who was the best lawyer in Richmond, asked
he of his host? "The man who just passed us, John
Marshall by name," said the tavern-keeper. But
the countryman would have none of Marshall. His
appearance did not fill the old man's idea of a practitioner
before the courts. He wanted, for his hundred
dollars, a lawyer who looked like a lawyer. He
would go to the court-room itself and there ask for
further recommendation. But again he was told by
the clerk of the court to retain Marshall, who, meanwhile,
had ambled into the court-room.</p>

<p>But no! This searcher for a legal champion would
use his own judgment. Soon a venerable, dignified
person, solemn of face, with black coat and powdered
wig, entered the room. At once the planter retained
him. The client remained in the court-room, it appears,
to listen to the lawyers in the other cases that
were ahead of his own. Thus he heard the pompous
advocate whom he had chosen; and then, in astonishment,
listened to Marshall.</p>

<p>The attorney of impressive appearance turned out
to be so inferior to the eccentric-looking advocate
that the planter went to Marshall, frankly told him
the circumstances, and apologized. Explaining that
he had but five dollars left, the troubled old farmer
asked Marshall whether he would conduct his case
for that amount. With a kindly jest about the power
of a black coat and a powdered wig, Marshall good-naturedly
accepted.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>This not too highly colored story is justified by
all reports of Marshall that have come down to us.
It is some such picture that we must keep before us
as we follow this astonishing man in the henceforth
easy and giant, albeit accidental, strides of his great
career. John Marshall, after he had become the
leading lawyer of Virginia, and, indeed, throughout
his life, was the simple, unaffected man whom the
tale describes. Perhaps consciousness of his own
strength contributed to his disregard of personal
appearance and contempt for studied manners. For
Marshall knew that he carried heavier guns than
other men. "No one," says Story, who knew him
long and intimately, "ever possessed a more entire
sense of his own extraordinary talents ... than he."<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's most careful contemporary observer,
William Wirt, tells us that Marshall was "in his
person, tall, meagre, emaciated; his muscles relaxed
and his joints so loosely connected, as not only to
disqualify him, apparently, for any vigorous exertion
of body, but to destroy everything like elegance
and harmony in his air and movements.</p>

<p>"Indeed, in his whole appearance, and demeanour;
dress, attitudes, gesture; sitting, standing, or walking;
he is as far removed from the idolized graces of
lord Chesterfield, as any other gentleman on earth.</p>

<p>"To continue the portrait; his head and face are
small in proportion to his height; his complexion
swarthy; the muscles of his face being relaxed; ...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
his countenance has a faithful expression of great
good humour and hilarity; while his black eyes&mdash;that
unerring index&mdash;possess an irradiating spirit
which proclaims the imperial powers of the mind that
sits enthroned within....</p>

<p>"His voice is dry, and hard; his attitude, in his
most effective orations, often extremely awkward;
as it was not unusual for him to stand with his left
foot in advance, while all his gesture proceeded from
his right arm, and consisted merely in a vehement,
perpendicular swing of it from about the elevation
of his head to the bar, behind which he was accustomed
to stand."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>During all the years of clamorous happenings, from
the great Virginia Convention of 1788 down to the
beginning of Adams's Administration and in the
midst of his own active part in the strenuous politics
of the time, Marshall practiced his profession, although
intermittently. However, during the critical
three weeks of plot and plan, debate and oratory in
the famous month of June, 1788, he managed to do
some "law business": while Virginia's Constitutional
Convention was in session, he received twenty
fees, most of them of one and two pounds and the
largest from "Col<sup>o&#803;</sup> W. Miles Cary 6.4." He drew
a deed for his fellow member of the Convention,
James Madison, while the Convention was in session,
for which he charged his colleague one pound
and four shillings.</p>

<p>But there was no time for card-playing during this
notable month and no whist or backgammon en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>tries
appear in Marshall's Account Book. Earlier
in the year we find such social expenses as "Card
table 5.10 Cards 8/ paper 2/-6" and "expenses and
loss at billiards at dif<sup>t</sup> times 3" (pounds). In
September, 1788, occurs the first entry for professional
literature, "Law books 20/-1"; but a more
important book purchase was that of "Mazai's book
sur les etats unis<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> 18" (shillings), an entry which
shows that some of Marshall's family could read
French.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's law practice during this pivotal year
was fairly profitable. He thus sums up his earnings
and outlay, "Rec<sup>d&#803;</sup> in the year 1788 1169.05; and expended
in year 1788, 515-13-7" which left Marshall
more than 653 pounds or about $1960 Virginia currency
clear profit for the year.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>The following year (1789) he did a little better, his
net profit being a trifle over seven hundred pounds,
or about $2130 Virginia currency. In 1790 he earned
a few shillings more than 1427 pounds and had about
$2400 Virginia currency remaining, after paying all
expenses. In 1791 he did not do so well, yet he
cleared over $2200 Virginia currency. In 1792 his
earnings fell off a good deal, yet he earned more than
he expended, over 402 pounds (a little more than
$1200 Virginia currency).</p>

<p>In 1793 Marshall was slightly more successful, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
his expenses also increased, and he ended this year
with a trifle less than 400 pounds clear profit. He
makes no summary in 1794, but his Account Book
shows that he no more than held his own. This business
barometer does not register beyond the end of
1795,<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> and there is no further evidence than the general
understanding current in Richmond as to the
amount of his earnings after this date. La Rochefoucauld
reported in 1797 that "Mr. Marshall does
not, from his practice, derive above four or five
thousand dollars per annum and not even that sum
every year."<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> We may take this as a trustworthy
estimate of Marshall's income; for the noble French
traveler and student was thorough in his inquiries
and took great pains to verify his statements.</p>

<p>In 1789 Marshall bought the tract of land amounting
to an entire city "square" of two acres,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> on which,
four years later, he built the comfortable brick residence
where he lived, while in Richmond, during the
remainder of his life. This house still stands (1916)
and is in excellent repair. It contains nine rooms,
most of them commodious, and one of them of generous
dimensions where Marshall gave the "lawyer
dinners" which, later, became so celebrated. This
structure was one of a number of the important
houses of Richmond.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> Near by were the residences
of Colonel Edward Carrington, Daniel Call, an ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>cellent
lawyer, and George Fisher, a wealthy merchant;
these men had married the three sisters of
Marshall's wife. The house of Jacquelin Ambler was
also one of this cluster of dwellings. So that Marshall
was in daily association with four men to whom he
was related by marriage, a not negligible circumstance;
for every one of them was a strong and successful
man, and all of them were, like Marshall,
pronounced Federalists. Their views and tastes were
the same, they mutually aided and supported one
another; and Marshall was, of course, the favorite
of this unusual family group.</p>

<p>In the same locality lived the Leighs, Wickhams,
Ronalds, and others, who, with those just mentioned,
formed the intellectual and social aristocracy of the
little city.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Richmond grew rapidly during the first
two decades that Marshall lived there. From the village
of a few hundred people abiding in small wooden
houses, in 1783, the Capital became, in 1795, a vigorous
town of six thousand inhabitants, dwelling mostly
in attractive brick residences.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> This architectural
transformation was occasioned by a fire which, in
1787, destroyed most of the buildings in Richmond.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
Business kept pace with the growth of the city,
wealth gradually and healthfully accumulated, and
the comforts of life appeared. Marshall steadily
wove his activities into those of the developing Virginia
metropolis and his prosperity increased in
moderate and normal fashion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>In his personal business affairs Marshall showed
a childlike faith in human nature which sometimes
worked to his disadvantage. For instance, in 1790
he bought a considerable tract of land in Buckingham
County, which was heavily encumbered by a
deed of trust to secure "a debt of a former owner"
of the land to Caron de Beaumarchais.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Marshall
knew of this mortgage "at the time of the purchase,
but he felt no concern ... because" the seller verbally
"promised to pay the debt and relieve the land
from the incumbrance."</p>

<p>So he made the payments through a series of
years, in spite of the fact that Beaumarchais's mortgage
remained unsatisfied, that Marshall urged its
discharge, and, finally, that disputes concerning it
arose. Perhaps the fact that he was the attorney
of the Frenchman in important litigation quieted
apprehension. Beaumarchais having died, his agent,
unable to collect the debt, was about to sell the land
under the trust deed, unless Marshall would pay the
obligation it secured. Thus, thirteen years after
this improvident transaction, Marshall was forced
to take the absurd tangle into a court of equity.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>But he was as careful of matters entrusted to
him by others as this land transaction would suggest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
that he was negligent of his own affairs. Especially
was he in demand, it would seem, when an enterprise
was to be launched which required public confidence
for its success. For instance, the subscribers
to a fire insurance company appointed him on the
committee to examine the proposed plan of business
and to petition the Legislature for a charter,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> which
was granted under the name of the "Mutual Assurance
Society of Virginia."<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Thus Marshall was a
founder of one of the oldest American fire insurance
companies.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Again, when in 1792 the "Bank of
Virginia," a State institution, was organized,<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
Marshall was named as one of the committee to
receive and approve subscriptions for stock.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>No man could have been more watchful than was
Marshall of the welfare of members of his family.
At one of the most troubled moments of his life, when
greatly distressed by combined business and political
complications,<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> he notes a love affair of his sister and,
unasked, carefully reviews the eligibility of her suitor.
Writing to his brother James on business and politics,
he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I understand that my sister Jane, while here
[Richmond], was addressed by Major Taylor and
that his addresses were encouraged by her. I am not
by any means certain of the fact nor did I suspect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
it until we had separated the night preceding her
departure and consequently I could have no conversation
with her concerning it.</p>

<p>"I believe that tho' Major Taylor was attach'd to
her, it would probably have had no serious result if
Jane had not manifested some partiality for him.
This affair embarrasses me a good deal. Major Taylor
is a young gentleman of talents and integrity for
whom I profess and feel a real friendship. There is
no person with whom I should be better pleased if
there were not other considerations which ought not
to be overlook'd. Mr. Taylor possesses but little
if any fortune, he is encumbered with a family, and
does not like his profession. Of course he will be as
eminent in his profession as his talents entitle him
to be. These are facts unknown to my sister but
which ought to be known to her.</p>

<p>"Had I conjectured that Mr. Taylor was contemplated
in the character of a lover I shou'd certainly
have made to her all proper communications.
I regret that it was concealed from me. I have a sincere
and real affection and esteem for Major Taylor
but I think it right in affairs of this sort that the real
situation of the parties should be mutually understood.
Present me affectionately to my sister."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>From the beginning of his residence in Richmond,
Marshall had been an active member of the Masonic
Order. He had become a Free Mason while in
the Revolutionary army,<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> which abounded in camp
lodges. It was due to his efforts as City Recorder of
Richmond that a lottery was successfully conducted
to raise funds for the building of a Masonic hall in
the State Capital in 1785.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> The following year Marshall
was appointed Deputy Grand Master. In 1792
he presided over the Grand Lodge as Grand Master
<i>pro tempore</i>; and the next year he was chosen as the
head of the order in Virginia. He was re&euml;lected as
Grand Master in 1794; and presided over the meetings
of the Grand Lodge held during 1793 until 1795
inclusive. During the latter year the Masonic hall
in Manchester was begun and he assisted in the ceremonies
attending the laying of the corner-stone,
which bore this inscription: "This stone was laid

<p>Upon the expiration of his second term in this
office, the Grand Lodge "Resolved, that the Grand
Lodge are truly sensible of the great attention of our
late Grand Master, John Marshall, to the duties of
Masonry, and that they entertain an high sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of the wisdom displayed by him in the discharge of

Past Master's jewel."<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>From 1790 until his election to Congress, nine
years later,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Marshall argued one hundred and
thirteen cases decided by the Court of Appeals of
Virginia. Notwithstanding his almost continuous
political activity, he appeared, during this time, in
practically every important cause heard and determined
by the supreme tribunal of the State. Whenever
there was more than one attorney for the client
who retained Marshall, the latter almost invariably
was reserved to make the closing argument. His absorbing
mind took in everything said or suggested
by counsel who preceded him; and his logic easily
marshaled the strongest arguments to support his
position and crushed or threw aside as unimportant
those advanced against him.</p>

<p>Marshall preferred to close rather than open an
argument. He wished to hear all that other counsel
might have to say before he spoke himself; for, as
has appeared, he was but slightly equipped with
legal learning<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> and he informed himself from the
knowledge displayed by his adversaries. Even after
he had become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
of the United States and throughout his long and
epochal occupancy of that high place, Marshall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>showed this same peculiarity which was so prominent
in his practice at the bar.</p>

<p>Every contemporary student of Marshall's method
and equipment notes the meagerness of his learning
in the law. "Everyone has heard of the gigantick
abilities of John Marshall; as a most able and profound
reasoner he deserves all the praise which has
been lavished upon him," writes Francis Walker
Gilmer, in his keen and brilliant contemporary
analysis of Marshall. "His mind is not very richly
stored with knowledge," he continues, "but it is so
creative, so well organized by nature, or disciplined
by early education, and constant habits of systematick
thinking, that he embraces every subject
with the clearness and facility of one prepared by
previous study to comprehend and explain it."<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>Gustavus Schmidt, who was a competent critic
of legal attainments and whose study of Marshall
as a lawyer was painstaking and thorough, bears
witness to Marshall's scanty acquirements. "Mr.
Marshall," says Schmidt, "can hardly be regarded
as a learned lawyer.... His acquaintance with the
Roman jurisprudence as well as with the laws of
foreign countries was not very extensive. He was
what is called a common law lawyer in the best &amp;
noblest acceptation of that term."</p>

<p>Mr. Schmidt attempts to excuse Marshall's want
of those legal weapons which knowledge of the books
supply.</p>

<p>"He was educated for the bar," writes Schmidt,
"at a period when digests, abridgments &amp; all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>numerous facilities, which now smooth the path of
the law student were almost unknown &amp; when you
often sought in vain in the Reporters which usually
wore the imposing form of folios, even for an index
of the decisions &amp; when marginal notes of the points
determined in a case was a luxury not to be either
looked for or expected.</p>

<p>"At this period when the principles of the Common
Law had to be studied in the black-letter pages
of Coke upon Littleton, a work equally remarkable
for quaintness of expression, profundity of research
and the absence of all method in the arrangements of
its very valuable materials; when the rules of pleading
had to be looked for in Chief Justice Saunders's
Reports, while the doctrinal parts of the jurisprudence,
based almost exclusively on the precedents
had to be sought after in the reports of Dyer, Plowden,
Coke, Popham ... it was ... no easy task to
become an able lawyer &amp; it required no common
share of industry and perseverance to amass sufficient
knowledge of the law to make even a decent
appearance in the forum."<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>It would not be strange, therefore, if Marshall did
cite very few authorities in the scores of cases argued
by him. But it seems certain that he would not have
relied upon the "learning of the law" in any event;
for at a later period, when precedents were more
abundant and accessible, he still ignored them.
Even in these early years other counsel exhibited
the results of much research; but not so Marshall.
In most of his arguments, as reported in volumes one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
two, and four of Call's Virginia Reports and in volumes
one and two of Washington's Virginia Reports,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
he depended on no authority whatever. Frequently
when the arguments of his associates and of opposing
counsel show that they had explored the whole
field of legal learning on the subject in hand, Marshall
referred to no precedent.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> The strongest feature
of his argument was his statement of the case.</p>

<p>The multitude of cases which Marshall argued
before the General Court of Appeals and before the
High Court of Chancery at Richmond covered every
possible subject of litigation at that time. He lost
almost as frequently as he won. Out of one hundred
and twenty-one cases reported, Marshall was on
the winning side sixty-two times and on the losing
side fifty times. In two cases he was partly successful
and partly unsuccessful, and in seven it is
impossible to tell from the reports what the outcome
was.</p>

<p>Once Marshall appeared for clients whose cause
was so weak that the court decided against him on
his own argument, refusing to hear opposing counsel.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
He was extremely frank and honest with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
court, and on one occasion went so far as to say that
the opposing counsel was in the right and himself
in the wrong.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> "My own opinion," he admitted to
the court in this case, "is that the law is correctly
stated by Mr. Ronald [the opposing counsel], but
the point has been otherwise determined in the
General Court." Marshall, of course, lost.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>Nearly all the cases in which Marshall was engaged
concerned property rights. Only three or four
of the controversies in which he took part involved
criminal law. A considerable part of the litigation in
which he was employed was intricate and involved;
and in this class of cases his lucid and orderly mind
made him the intellectual master of the contending
lawyers. Marshall's ability to extract from the confusion
of the most involved question its vital elements
and to state those elements in simple terms
was helpful to the court, and frankly appreciated by
the judges.</p>

<p>Few letters of Marshall to his fellow lawyers written
during this period are extant. Most of these are
very brief and confined strictly to the particular
cases which he had been retained by his associate
attorneys throughout Virginia to conduct before
the Court of Appeals. Occasionally, however, his
humor breaks forth.</p>

<p>"I cannot appear for Donaghoe," writes Marshall
to a country member of the bar who lived in the Valley
over the mountains. "I do not decline his business
from any objection to his <i>bank</i>. To that I should
like very well to have free access &amp; wou'd certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
discount <i>from</i> it as largely as he wou'd permit, but I
am already fixed by Rankin &amp; as those who are once
in the bank do not I am told readily get out again I
despair of being ever able to touch the guineas of
Donaghoe.</p>

<p>"Shall we never see you again in Richmond? I
was very much rejoiced when I heard that you were
happily married but if that amounts to a ne exeat
which is to confine you entirely to your side of the
mountain, I shall be selfish enough to regret your
good fortune &amp; almost wish you had found some
little crooked rib among the fish and oysters which
would once a year drag you into this part of our
terraqueous globe.</p>

<p>"You have forgotten I believe the solemn compact
we made to take a journey to Philadelphia together
this winter and superintend for a while the
proceedings of Congress."<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>Again, writing to Stuart concerning a libel suit,
Marshall says: "Whether the truth of the libel may
be justified or not is a perfectly unsettled question.
If in that respect the law here varies from the law
of England it must be because such is the will of their
Honors for I know of no legislative act to vary it.
It will however be right to appeal was it only to
secure a compromise."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's sociableness and love of play made him
the leader of the Barbecue Club, consisting of
thirty of the most agreeable of the prominent men
in Richmond. Membership in this club was eagerly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
sought and difficult to secure, two negatives being
sufficient to reject a candidate. Meetings were held
each Saturday, in pleasant weather, at "the springs"
on the farm of Mr. Buchanan, the Episcopal clergyman.
There a generous meal was served and games
played, quoits being the favorite sport. One such
occasion of which there is a trustworthy account
shows the humor, the wit, and the good-fellowship
of Marshall.</p>

<p>He welcomed the invited guests, Messrs. Blair and
Buchanan, the famous "Two Parsons" of Richmond,
and then announced that a fine of a basket
of champagne, imposed on two members for talking
politics at a previous meeting of the club, had been
paid and that the wine was at hand. It was drunk
from tumblers and the Presbyterian minister joked
about the danger of those who "drank from tumblers
<i>on</i> the table becoming tumblers <i>under</i> the table."
Marshall challenged "Parson" Blair to a game of
quoits, each selecting four partners. His quoits were
big, rough, heavy iron affairs that nobody else could
throw, those of the other players being smaller and
of polished brass. Marshall rang the meg and Blair
threw his quoit directly over that of his opponent.
Loud were the cries of applause and a great controversy
arose as to which player had won. The decision
was left to the club with the understanding that
when the question was determined they should
"crack another bottle of champagne."</p>

<p>Marshall argued his own case with great solemnity
and elaboration. The one first ringing the meg must
be deemed the winner, unless his adversary knocked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
off the first quoit and put his own in its place. This
required perfection, which Blair did not possess.
Blair claimed to have won by being on top of Marshall;
but suppose he tried to reach heaven "by riding
on my back," asked Marshall. "I fear that from
my many backslidings and deficiencies, he may be
badly disappointed." Blair's method was like playing
leap frog, said he. And did anybody play backgammon
in that way? Also there was the ancient
legal maxim, "<i>Cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad
c&#339;lum</i>": being "the first occupant his right extended
from the ground up to the vault of heaven and no one
had a right to become a squatter on his back." If
Blair had any claim "he must obtain a writ of ejectment
or drive him [Marshall] from his position vi et
armis." Marshall then cited the boys' game of
marbles and, by analogy, proved that he had won
and should be given the verdict of the club.</p>

<p>Wickham argued at length that the judgment of
the club should be that "where two adversary quoits
are on the same meg, neither is victorious." Marshall's
quoit was so big and heavy that no ordinary
quoit could move it and "no rule requires an impossibility."
As to Marshall's insinuation that Blair
was trying to reach "Elysium by mounting on his
back," it was plain to the club that such was not the
parson's intention, but that he meant only to get a
more elevated view of earthly things. Also Blair, by
"riding on that pinnacle," will be apt to arrive in
time at the upper round of the ladder of fame. The
legal maxim cited by Marshall was really against his
claim, since the ground belonged to Mr. Buchanan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and Marshall was as much of a "squatter" as Blair
was. "The first squatter was no better than the
second." And why did Marshall talk of ejecting him
by force of arms? Everybody knew that "parsons are
men of peace and do not vanquish their antagonists
<i>vi et armis</i>. We do not deserve to prolong this riding
on Mr. Marshall's back; he is too much of a <i>Rosinante</i>
to make the ride agreeable." The club declined
to consider seriously Marshall's comparison of the
manly game of quoits with the boys' game of marbles,
for had not one of the clergymen present
preached a sermon on "marvel not"? There was no
analogy to quoits in Marshall's citation of leap frog
nor of backgammon; and Wickham closed, amid the
cheers of the club, by pointing out the difference
between quoits and leap frog.</p>

<p>The club voted with impressive gravity, taking
care to make the vote as even as possible and finally
determined that the disputed throw was a draw.
The game was resumed and Marshall won.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>Such were Marshall's diversions when an attorney
at Richmond. His "lawyer dinners" at his house,<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
his card playing at Farmicola's tavern, his quoit-throwing
and pleasant foolery at the Barbecue Club,
and other similar amusements which served to take
his mind from the grave problems on which, at other
times, it was constantly working, were continued, as
we shall see, and with increasing zest, after he became
the world's leading jurist-statesman of his
time. But neither as lawyer nor judge did these
wholesome frivolities interfere with his serious work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall's first case of nation-wide interest, in
which his argument gave him fame among lawyers
throughout the country, was the historic controversy
over the British debts. When Congress enacted the
Judiciary Law of 1789 and the National Courts were
established, British creditors at once began action to
recover their long overdue debts. During the Revolution,
other States as well as Virginia had passed
laws confiscating the debts which their citizens owed
British subjects and sequestering British property.</p>

<p>Under these laws, debtors could cancel their
obligations in several ways. The Treaty of Peace
between the United States and Great Britain provided,
among other things, that "It is agreed that
creditors on either side shall meet with no legal impediments
to the recovery of the full value in sterling
money of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted."
The Constitution provided that "All treaties made, or
which shall be made, under the authority of the United
States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the
judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything
in the Constitution or laws of any State to the
contrary notwithstanding,"<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> and that "The judicial
power shall extend to all cases in law and equity
arising under this Constitution, the laws of the
United States, and treaties made, or which shall be
made, under their authority; to all cases ... between
a State, or the citizens thereof, and foreign
States citizens, or subjects."<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>Thus the case of Ware, Administrator, <i>vs.</i> Hylton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">et al.</span>, which involved the validity of a State law in
conflict with a treaty, attracted the attention of the
whole country when finally it reached the Supreme
Court. The question in that celebrated controversy
was whether a State law, suspending the collection
of a debt due to a subject of Great Britain, was valid
as against the treaty which provided that no "legal
impediment" should prevent the recovery of the
obligation.</p>

<p>Ware <i>vs.</i> Hylton was a test case; and its decision
involved immense sums of money. Large numbers of
creditors who had sought to cancel their debts under
the confiscation laws were vitally interested. Marshall,
in this case, made the notable argument that
carried his reputation as a lawyer beyond Virginia
and won for him the admiration of the ablest men
at the bar, regardless of their opinion of the merits of
the controversy.</p>

<p>It is an example of "the irony of fate" that in this
historic legal contest Marshall supported the theory
which he had opposed throughout his public career
thus far, and to demolish which his entire after life
was given. More remarkable still, his efforts for
his clients were opposed to his own interests; for,
had he succeeded for those who employed him, he
would have wrecked the only considerable business
transaction in which he ever engaged.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> He was
employed by the debtors to uphold those laws of
Virginia which sequestered British property and
prevented the collection of the British debts; and
he put forth all his power in this behalf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Three such cases were pending in Virginia; and
these were heard twice by the National Court in
Richmond as a consolidated cause, the real issue
being the same in all. The second hearing was during
the May Term of 1793 before Chief Justice Jay, Justice
Iredell of the Supreme Court, and Judge Griffin
of the United States District Court. The attorneys
for the British creditors were William Ronald, John
Baker, John Stark, and John Wickham. For the defendants
were Alexander Campbell, James Innes,
Patrick Henry, and John Marshall. Thus we see
Marshall, when thirty-six years of age, after ten
years of practice at the Richmond bar, interrupted
as those years were by politics and legislative activities,
one of the group of lawyers who, for power, brilliancy,
and learning, were unsurpassed in America.</p>

<p>The argument at the Richmond hearing was a
brilliant display of eloquence, reasoning, and erudition,
and, among lawyers, its repute has reached even
to the present day. Counsel on both sides exerted
every ounce of their strength. When Patrick Henry
had finished his appeal, Justice Iredell was so overcome
that he cried, "Gracious God! He is an orator
indeed!"<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> The Countess of Huntingdon, who was
then in Richmond and heard the arguments of all
the attorneys, declared: "If every one had spoken in
Westminster Hall, they would have been honored
with a peerage."<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>In his formal opinion, Justice Iredell thus expressed
his admiration: "The cause has been spoken
to, at the bar, with a degree of ability equal to any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
occasion.... I shall as long as I live, remember with
pleasure and respect the arguments which I have
heard on this case: they have discovered an ingenuity,
a depth of investigation, and a power of
reasoning fully equal to anything I have ever witnessed....
Fatigue has given way under its influence;
the heart has been warmed, while the understanding
has been instructed."<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's argument before the District Court of
Richmond must have impressed his debtor clients
more than that of any other of their distinguished
counsel, with the single exception of Alexander
Campbell; for when, on appeal to the Supreme Court
of the United States, the case came on for hearing
in 1796, we find that only Marshall and Campbell
appeared for the debtors.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that Marshall's argument before
the Supreme Court at Philadelphia is very poorly
reported. But inadequate as the report is, it still
reveals the peculiar clearness and the compact and
simple reasoning which made up the whole of Marshall's
method, whether in legal arguments, political
speeches, diplomatic letters, or judicial opinions.</p>

<p>Marshall argued that the Virginia law barred
the recovery of the debts regardless of the treaty.
"It has been conceded," said he, "that independent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
nations have, in general, the right to confiscation;
and that Virginia, at the time of passing her law,
was an independent nation." A State engaged in war
has the powers of war, "and confiscation is one of
those powers, weakening the party against whom
it is employed and strengthening the party that employs
it." Nations have equal powers; and, from
July 4, 1776, America was as independent a nation
as Great Britain. What would have happened if
Great Britain had been victorious? "Sequestration,
confiscation, and proscription would have followed
in the train of that event," asserted Marshall.</p>

<p>Why, then, he asked, "should the confiscation of
British property be deemed less just in the event of
an American triumph?" Property and its disposition
is not a natural right, but the "creature of civil
society, and subject in all respects to the disposition
and control of civil institutions." Even if "an individual
has not the power of extinguishing his debts,"
still "the community to which he belongs ... may ... upon principles of public policy, prevent his creditors
from recovering them." The ownership and
control of property "is the offspring of the social
state; not the incident of a state of nature. But the
Revolution did not reduce the inhabitants of America
to a state of nature; and if it did, the plaintiff's claim
would be at an end." Virginia was within her rights
when she confiscated these debts.</p>

<p>As an independent nation Virginia could do as she
liked, declared Marshall. Legally, then, at the time
of the Treaty of Peace in 1783, "the defendant owed
nothing to the plaintiff." Did the treaty revive the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
debt thus extinguished? No: For the treaty provides
"that creditors on either side shall meet with no
lawful impediment to the recovery" of their debts.
Who are the creditors? "There cannot be a creditor
where there is not a debt; and the British debts
were extinguished by the act of confiscation," which
was entirely legal.</p>

<p>Plainly, then, argued Marshall, the treaty "must
be construed with reference to those creditors"
whose debts had not been extinguished by the sequestration
laws. There were cases of such debts
and it was to these only that the treaty applied. The
Virginia law must have been known to the commissioners
who made the treaty; and it was unthinkable
that they should attempt to repeal those laws in the
treaty without using plain words to that effect.</p>

<p>Such is an outline of Marshall's argument, as inaccurately
and defectively reported.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>Cold and dry as it appears in the reporter's notes,
Marshall's address to the Supreme Court made a tremendous
impression on all who heard it. When he
left the court-room, he was followed by admiring
crowds. The ablest public men at the Capital were
watching Marshall narrowly and these particularly
were captivated by his argument. "His head is
one of the best organized of any one that I have
known," writes the keenly observant King, a year
later, in giving to Pinckney his estimate of Marshall.
"This I say from general Reputation, and more satisfactorily
from an Argument that I heard him de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>liver
before the fed'l Court at Philadelphia."<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> King's
judgment of Marshall's intellectual strength was
that generally held.</p>

<p>Marshall's speech had a more enduring effect on
those who listened to it than any other address he
ever made, excepting that on the Jonathan Robins
case.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Twenty-four years afterwards William Wirt,
then at the summit of his brilliant career, advising
Francis Gilmer upon the art of oratory, recalled Marshall's
argument in the British Debts case as an
example for Gilmer to follow. Wirt thus contrasts
Marshall's method with that of Campbell on the
same occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Campbell played off all his Apollonian airs; but
they were lost. Marshall spoke, as he always does,
to the judgment merely and for the simple purpose
of convincing. Marshall was justly pronounced one
of the greatest men of the country; he was followed
by crowds, looked upon, and courted with every
evidence of admiration and respect for the great
powers of his mind. Campbell was neglected and
slighted, and came home in disgust.</p>

<p>"Marshall's maxim seems always to have been, 'aim
exclusively <i>at Strength</i>:' and from his eminent success,
I say, if I had my life to go over again, I would
practice on his maxim with the most rigorous severity,
until the character of my mind was established."<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>
<p>In another letter to Gilmer, Wirt again urges his
son-in-law to imitate Marshall's style. In his early
career Wirt had suffered in his own arguments from
too much adornment which detracted from the real
solidity and careful learning of his efforts at the bar.
And when, finally, in his old age he had, through his
own mistakes, learned the value of simplicity in statement
and clear logic in argument, he counseled young
Gilmer accordingly.</p>

<p>"In your arguments at the bar," he writes, "<i>let
argument strongly predominate</i>. Sacrifice your flowers....
Avoid as you would the gates of death, the
reputation for floridity.... Imitate ... Marshall's
simple process of reasoning."<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>Following the advice of his distinguished brother-in-law,
Gilmer studied Marshall with the hungry
zeal of ambitious youth. Thus it is that to Francis
Gilmer we owe what is perhaps the truest analysis,
made by a personal observer, of Marshall's method as
advocate and orator.</p>

<p>"So perfect is his analysis," records Gilmer,
"that he extracts the whole matter, the kernel
of the inquiry, unbroken, undivided, clean and entire.
In this process, such is the instinctive neatness
and precision of his mind that no superfluous
thought, or even word, ever presents itself and still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
he says everything that seems appropriate to the
subject.</p>

<p>"This perfect exemption from any unnecessary
encumbrance of matter or ornament, is in some degree
the effect of an aversion for the labour of thinking.
So great a mind, perhaps, like large bodies in
the physical world, is with difficulty set in motion.
That this is the case with Mr. Marshall's is manifest,
from his mode of entering on an argument both in
conversation and in publick debate.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to rouse his faculties; he begins with
reluctance, hesitation, and vacancy of eye; presently
his articulation becomes less broken, his eye more
fixed, until finally, his voice is full, clear, and rapid,
his manner bold, and his whole face lighted up, with
the mingled fires of genius and passion; and he pours
forth the unbroken stream of eloquence, in a current
deep, majestick, smooth, and strong.</p>

<p>"He reminds one of some great bird, which flounders
and flounces on the earth for a while before it
acquires the impetus to sustain its soaring flight.</p>

<p>"The characteristick of his eloquence is an irresistible
cogency, and a luminous simplicity in the
order of his reasoning. His arguments are remarkable
for their separate and independent strength, and for
the solid, compact, impenetrable order in which they
are arrayed.</p>

<p>"He certainly possesses in an eminent degree the
power which had been ascribed to him, of mastering
the most complicated subjects with facility, and
when moving with his full momentum, even without
the appearance of resistance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Comparing Marshall and Randolph, Gilmer says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The powers of these two gentlemen are strikingly
contrasted by nature. In Mr. Marshall's
speeches, all is reasoning; in Mr. Randolph's everything
is declamation. The former scarcely uses a
figure; the latter hardly an abstraction. One is awkward;
the other graceful.</p>

<p>"One is indifferent as to his words, and slovenly
in his pronunciation; the other adapts his phrases
to the sense with poetick felicity; his voice to the
sound with musical exactness.</p>

<p>"There is no breach in the train of Mr. Marshall's
thoughts; little connection between Mr. Randolph's.
Each has his separate excellence, but either is far
from being a finished orator."<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>Another invaluable first-hand analysis of Marshall's
style and manner of argument is that of William
Wirt, himself, in the vivacious descriptions of
"The British Spy":&mdash;</p>

<p>"He possesses one original, and, almost supernatural
faculty, the faculty of developing a subject
by a single glance of his mind, and detecting at
once, the very point on which every controversy
depends. No matter what the question; though
ten times more knotty than 'the gnarled oak,' the
lightning of heaven is not more rapid nor more
resistless, than his astonishing penetration.</p>

<p>"Nor does the exercise of it seem to cost him an
effort. On the contrary, it is as easy as vision. I am
persuaded that his eye does not fly over a landscape
and take in its various objects with more prompti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>tude
and facility, than his mind embraces and analyses
the most complex subject.</p>

<p>"Possessing while at the bar this intellectual elevation,
which enabled him to look down and comprehend
the whole ground at once, he determined
immediately and without difficulty, on which side
the question might be most advantageously approached
and assailed.</p>

<p>"In a bad cause his art consisted in laying his
premises so remotely from the point directly in
debate, or else in terms so general and so spacious,
that the hearer, seeing no consequence which could
be drawn from them, was just as willing to admit
them as not; but his premises once admitted, the
demonstration, however distant, followed as certainly,
as cogently, as inevitably, as any demonstration
in Euclid."<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's supremacy, now unchallenged, at the
Virginia bar was noted by foreign observers. La
Rochefoucauld testifies to this in his exhaustive
volumes of travel:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. J. Marshall, conspicuously eminent as a
professor of the law, is beyond all doubt one of those
who rank highest in the public opinion at Richmond.
He is what is termed a federalist, and perhaps
somewhat warm in support of his opinions, but
never exceeding the bounds of propriety, which a
man of his goodness and prudence and knowledge
is incapable of transgressing.</p>

<p>"He may be considered as a distinguished character
in the United States. His political enemies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
allow him to possess great talents but accuse him of
ambition. I know not whether the charge be well
or ill grounded, or whether that ambition might ever
be able to impel him to a dereliction of his principles&mdash;a
conduct of which I am inclined to disbelieve
the possibility on his part.</p>

<p>"He has already refused several employments
under the general government, preferring the income
derived from his professional labours (which
is more than sufficient for his moderate system of
economy), together with a life of tranquil ease in
the midst of his family and in his native town.</p>

<p>"Even by his friends he is taxed with some little
propensity to indolence; but even if this reproach
were well founded, he nevertheless displays great
superiority in his profession when he applies his
mind to business."<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>When Jefferson foresaw Marshall's permanent
transfer to public life he advised James Monroe to
practice law in Richmond because "the business is
very profitable;<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> ... and an opening of great importance
must be made by the retirement of Marshall."<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall's solid and brilliant performance in the
British Debts case before the Supreme Court at
Philadelphia did much more than advance him in
his profession. It also focused upon him the keen
scrutiny of the politicians and statesmen who at that
time were in attendance upon Congress in the Quaker
City. Particularly did the strength and personality
of the Virginia advocate impress the Federalist
leaders.</p>

<p>These vigilant men had learned of Marshall's daring
championship of the Jay Treaty in hostile Virginia.
And although in the case of Ware <i>vs.</i> Hylton,
Marshall was doing his utmost as a lawyer before
the Supreme Court to defeat the collection of the
British debts, yet his courageous advocacy of the
Jay Treaty outweighed, in their judgment, his professional
labors in behalf of the clients who had
employed him.</p>

<p>The Federalist leaders were in sore need of Southern
support; and when Marshall was in Philadelphia
on the British Debts case, they were prompt and unsparing
in their efforts to bind this strong and able
man to them by personal ties. Marshall himself unwittingly
testifies to this. "I then [during this professional
visit to Philadelphia] became acquainted,"
he relates, "with Mr. Cabot, Mr. Ames, Mr. Dexter,
and Mr. Sedgwick of Massachusetts, Mr. Wadsworth
of Connecticut, and Mr. King of New York.
I was delighted with these gentlemen. The particular
subject (the British Treaty) which introduced me
to their notice was at that time so interesting, and
a Virginian who supported, with any sort of repu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>tation,
the measures of the government, was such a
<i>rara avis</i>, that I was received by them all with a
degree of kindness which I had not anticipated. I
was particularly intimate with Mr. Ames, and could
scarcely gain credit with him when I assured him
that the appropriations [to effectuate the treaty]
would be seriously opposed in Congress."<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>As we shall presently see, Marshall became associated
with Robert Morris in the one great business
undertaking of the former's life. Early in this transaction
when, for Marshall, the skies were still clear
of financial clouds, he appears to have made a small
purchase of bank stock and ventured modestly into
the commercial field. "I have received your letter
of 18 ulto," Morris writes Marshall, "&amp; am negotiating
for Bank Stock to answer your demand."<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>And again: "I did not succeed in the purchase of
the Bank Stock mentioned in my letter of the 3<sup>d</sup> Ulto
to you and as M<sup>r</sup> Richard tells me in his letter of the
4 Inst that you want the money for the Stock, you
may if you please draw upon me for $7000 giving
me as much time in the sight as you can, and I will
most certainly pay your drafts as they become due.
The Brokers shall fix the price of the Stock at the
market price at the time I pay the money &amp; I will
then state the Am<sup>t</sup> including Dividends &amp; remit
you the Balance but if you prefer having the Stock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
I will buy it on receiving your Answer to this, cost
what it may."<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>Soon afterward, Morris sent Marshall the promised
shares of stock, apparently to enable him to return
shares to some person in Richmond from whom he
had borrowed them.</p>

<p>"You will receive herewith enclosed the Certificates
for four shares of Bank Stock of the United
States placed in your name to enable you to return
the four shares to the Gentlemen of whom you borrowed
them, this I thought better than remitting
the money lest some difficulty should arise about
price of shares. Two other shares in the name of
M<sup>r</sup> Geo Pickett is also enclosed herewith and I
will go on buying and remitting others untill the
number of Ten are completed for him which shall
be done before the time limited in your letter of
the 12<sup>h</sup> Ins<sup>t</sup> The dividends shall also be remitted
speedily."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>Again Washington desired Marshall to fill an important
public office, this time a place on the joint
commission, provided for in the Jay Treaty, to settle
the British claims. These, as we have seen, had
been for many years a source of grave trouble between
the two countries. Their satisfactory adjustment
would mean, not only the final settlement of
this serious controversy, but the removal of an ever-present
cause of war.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> But since Marshall had re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>fused
appointment to three offices tendered him by
Washington, the President did not now communicate
with him directly, but inquired of Charles Lee,
Attorney-General of Virginia, whether Marshall
might be prevailed upon to accept this weighty and
delicate business.</p>

<p>"I have very little doubt," replied Lee, "that
Mr. John Marshall would not act as a Commissioner
under the Treaty with Great Britain, for deciding
on the claims of creditors. I have been long acquainted
with his private affairs, and I think it almost
impossible for him to undertake that office. If
he would, I know not any objection that subsists
against him.</p>

<p>"First, he is not a debtor.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Secondly, he cannot
be benefitted or injured by any decision of the Commissioners.
Thirdly, his being employed as counsel,
in suits of that kind, furnishes no reasonable objection;
nor do I know of any opinions that he has
published, or professes, that might, with a view of
impartiality, make him liable to be objected to.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marshall is at the head of his profession in
Virginia, enjoying every convenience and comfort;
in the midst of his friends and the relations of his
wife at Richmond; in a practice of his profession
that annually produces about five thousand dollars
on an average; with a young and increasing family;
and under a degree of necessity to continue his pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>fession,
for the purpose of complying with contracts
not yet performed."<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>The "contracts" which Marshall had to fulfill concerned
the one important financial adventure of his
life. It was this, and not, as some suppose, the condition
of his invalid wife, to which Marshall vaguely referred
in his letter to Washington declining appointment
as Attorney-General and as Minister to France.</p>

<p>The two decades following the establishment of the
National Government under the Constitution were
years of enormous land speculation. Hardly a prominent
man of the period failed to secure large tracts
of real estate, which could be had at absurdly low
prices, and to hold the lands for the natural advance
which increasing population would bring. The greatest
of these investors was Robert Morris, the financier
of the Revolution, the second richest man of the
time,<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> and the leading business man of the country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="474" height="640" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>John Marshall had long been the attorney in Virginia
for Robert Morris, who frequently visited
that State, sometimes taking his family with him.
In all probability, it was upon some such journey
that James M. Marshall, the brother of John Marshall,
met and became engaged to Hester Morris,
daughter of the great speculator, whom he married
on April 19, 1795.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> James M. Marshall&mdash;nine years
younger than his brother&mdash;possessed ability almost
equal to John Marshall and wider and more varied
accomplishments.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>It is likely that the Pennsylvania financier, before
the marriage, suggested to the Marshall brothers the
purchase of what remained of the Fairfax estate in
the Northern Neck, embracing over one hundred
and sixty thousand acres of the best land in Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
At any rate, sometime during 1793 or 1794 John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Marshall, his brother, James M. Marshall, his
brother-in-law, Rawleigh Colston, and General
Henry Lee contracted for the purchase of this valuable
holding.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> In January of that year James
M. Marshall sailed for England to close the bargain.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
The money to buy the Fairfax lands was to be
advanced by Robert Morris, who, partly for this
purpose, sent James M. Marshall to Europe to
negotiate<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> loans, immediately after his marriage
to Hester Morris.</p>

<p>At Amsterdam "some Capitalists proposed to
supply on very hard terms a Sum more than Sufficient
to pay Mr. Fairfax," writes Morris, and
James M. Marshall "has my authority to apply the
first Monies he receives on my acco<sup>t</sup> to that Payment."<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
By the end of 1796 Morris's over-speculations
had gravely impaired his fortune. The old
financier writes pathetically to James M. Marshall:
"I am struggling hard, very hard, indeed to regain
my Position." He tells his son-in-law that if a
loan cannot be obtained on his other real estate he
"expects these Washington Lotts will be the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
certain of any Property to raise Money on"; and
that "[I] will have a number of them Placed under
your Controul."<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>The loan failed, for the time being, but, writes
Morris to John Marshall, "Mr. Hottenguer<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> who
first put the thing in motion says it will come on
again" and succeed; "if so, your brother will, of
course, be ready for Mr. Fairfax." Morris is trying,
he says, to raise money from other sources lest that
should fail. "I am here distressed exceedingly in
money matters," continues the harried and aging
speculator "as indeed every body here are but I will
immediately make such exertions as are in my power
to place funds with your brother and I cannot but
hope that his and my exertions will produce the
needful in proper time to prevent mischief."<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>A month later Morris again writes John Marshall
that he is "extremely anxious &amp; fearing that it [the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Amsterdam loan] may fall through I am trying to
obtain a loan here for the purposes of your Brother
in London. This," says the now desperate financier,
"is extremely difficult, for those who have money or
credit in Europe seem to dread every thing that is
American." He assures John Marshall that he will
do his utmost. "My anxiety ... [to make good the
Fairfax purchase] is beyond what I can express."
Alexander Baring "could supply the money ... but
he parries me. He intends soon for the Southward
I will introduce him to you."<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>The title to the Fairfax estate had been the subject
of controversy for many years. Conflicting
grants, overlapping boundaries, sequestration laws,
the two treaties with Great Britain, were some of
the elements that produced confusion and uncertainty
in the public mind and especially in the
minds of those holding lands within the grant. The
only real and threatening clouds upon the title to the
lands purchased by the Marshall syndicate, however,
were the confiscatory laws passed during the
Revolution<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> which the Treaty of Peace and the Jay
Treaty nullified.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> There were also questions growing
out of grants made by the colonial authorities
between 1730 and 1736, but these were not weighty.</p>

<p>The case of Hunter <i>vs.</i> Fairfax, Devisee, involving
these questions, was pending in the Supreme Court
of the United States. John Marshall went to Phila<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>delphia
and tried to get the cause advanced and
decided. He was sadly disappointed at his failure
and so wrote his brother. "Your Brother has been
here," writes Morris to his son-in-law, "as you will
see by a letter from him forwarded by this conveyance.
He could not get your case brought forward
in the Supreme Court of the U. S. at which he was
much dissatisfied &amp; I am much concerned thereat,
fearing that real disadvantage will result to your
concern thereby."<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>The case came on for hearing in regular course
during the fall term. Hunter, on the death of his
attorney, Alexander Campbell, prayed the Court, by
letter, for a continuance, which was granted over the
protest of the Fairfax attorneys of record, Lee and
Ingersoll of Philadelphia, who argued that "from
the nature of the cause, delay would be worse for the
defendant in error [the Fairfax heir] than a decision
adverse to his claim." The Attorney-General stated
that the issue before the Court was "whether ...
the defendant in error being an alien can take and
hold the lands by devise. And it will be contended
that his title is completely protected by the treaty
of peace." Mr. Justice Chase remarked: "I recollect
that ... a decision in favor of such a devisee's title
was given by a court in Maryland. It is a matter,
however, of great moment and ought to be deliberately
and finally settled."<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> The Marshalls, of
course, stood in the shoes of the Fairfax devisee; had
the Supreme Court decided against the Fairfax title,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
their contract of purchase would have been nullified
and, while they would not have secured the estate, they
would have been relieved of the Fairfax indebtedness.
It was, then, a very grave matter to the Marshalls,
in common with all others deriving their titles from
Fairfax, that the question be settled quickly and
permanently.</p>

<p>A year or two before this purchase by the Marshalls
of what remained of the Fairfax estate, more
than two hundred settlers, occupying other parts of
it, petitioned the Legislature of Virginia to quiet their
titles.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Acting on these petitions and influenced,
perhaps, by the controversy over the sequestration
laws which the Marshall purchase renewed, the
Legislature in 1796 passed a resolution proposing to
compromise the dispute by the State's relinquishing
"all claim to any lands specifically appropriated by ... Lord Fairfax to his own use either by deed or
actual survey ... if the devises of Lord Fairfax, or
those claiming under them, will relinquish all claims
to lands ... which were waste and unappropriated
at the time of the death of Lord Fairfax."<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>Acting for the purchasing syndicate, John Marshall,
in a letter to the Speaker of the House, accepted
this legislative offer of settlement upon the
condition that "an act passes during this session
confirming ... the title of those claiming under
Mr. Fairfax the lands specifically appropriated and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
reserved by the late Thomas Lord Fairfax or his
ancestors for his or their use."<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>When advised of what everybody then supposed
to be the definitive settlement of this vexed controversy,
Robert Morris wrote John Marshall that
"altho' you were obliged to give up a part of your
claim yet it was probably better to do that than
to hold a contest with such an opponent [State of
Virginia]. I will give notice to M<sup>r&#803;</sup> Ja<sup>s&#803;</sup> Marshall of
this compromise."<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> John Marshall, now sure of
the title, and more anxious than ever to consummate
the deal by paying the Fairfax heir, hastened to
Philadelphia to see Morris about the money.</p>

<p>"Your Brother John Marshall Esq<sup>r&#803;</sup> is now in this
City," writes Robert Morris to his son-in-law,
"and his principal business I believe is to see how
you are provided with Money to pay Lord Fairfax.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>...
I am so sensible of the necessity there is for your
being prepared for Lord Fairfax's payment that
there is nothing within my power that I would not
do to enable you to meet it."<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>The members of the Marshall syndicate pressed
their Philadelphia backer unremittingly, it appears,
for a few days later he answers what seems to have
been a petulant letter from Colston assuring that
partner in the Fairfax transaction that he is doing his
utmost to "raise the money to enable Mr. James
Marshall to meet the Payments for your Purchase
at least so far as it is incumbent on me to supply the
means.... From the time named by John Marshall
Esq<sup>re</sup> when here, I feel perfect Confidence, because
I will furnish him before that period with such Resources
&amp; aid as I think cannot fail."<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>Finally Marshall's brother negotiated the loan,
an achievement which Morris found "very pleasing,
as it enables you to take the first steps with Lord
Fairfax for securing your bargain."<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Nearly forty
thousand dollars of this loan was thus applied. In
his book of accounts with Morris, James M. Marshall
enters: "Jany 25 '97 To &pound;7700 paid the Rev<sup>d&#803;</sup>
Denny Fairfax and credited in your [Morris's] account
with me 7700" (English pounds sterling).<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>total amount which the Marshalls had agreed
to pay for the remnant of the Fairfax estate was
"fourteen thousand pounds British money."<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> When
Robert Morris became bankrupt, payment of the
remainder of the Fairfax indebtedness fell on the
shoulders of Marshall and his brother.</p>

<p>This financial burden caused Marshall to break
his rule of declining office and to accept appointment
as one of our envoys to France at the time of
Robert Morris's failure and imprisonment for debt;
for from that public employment of less than one
year, Marshall, as we shall see, received in the sorely
needed cash, over and above his expenses, three
times the amount of his annual earnings at the bar.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
"Mr. John Marshall has said here," relates Jefferson
after Marshall's return, "that had he not been
appointed minister [envoy] to France, he was desperate
in his affairs and must have sold his estate [the
Fairfax purchase] &amp; that immediately. That that
appointment was the greatest God-send that could
ever have befallen a man."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Jefferson adds: "I have
this from J. Brown and S. T. Mason [Senator
Mason]."<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>So it was that Marshall accepted a place on the
mission to France<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> when it was offered to him by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>

man of his time." (Watson: <i>Annals of Philadelphia</i> i. 414.) Chastellux
estimates Morris's wealth at the close of the Revolution at 8,000,000
francs. (Chastellux, 107.) He increased his fortune many fold from
the close of the war to 1796.
</p><p>
The operations of Robert Morris in land were almost without limit.
For instance, one of the smaller items of his purchases was 199,480
acres in Burke County, North Carolina. (Robert Morris to James
M. Marshall, Sept. 24, 1795; Morris's Private Letter Book; MS.,
Lib. Cong.)
</p><p>
Another example of Morris's scattered and detached deals was his
purchase of a million acres "lying on the western counties of Virginia ... purchased
of William Cary Nicholas.... I do not consider one
shilling sterling as one fourth the real value of the lands.... If, therefore,"
writes Morris to James M. Marshall, "a little over &pound;5000 Stg.
could be made on this security it would be better than selling especially
at 12<sup>d&#803;</sup> per acre." (Robert Morris to James M. Marshall, Oct. 10,
1795; <i>ib.</i>)
</p><p>
Morris owned at one time or another nearly all of the western half
of New York State. (See Oberholtzer, 301 <i>et seq.</i>) "You knew of
Mr. Robert Morris's purchase ... of one million, three hundred

Patrick Henry acquired considerable holdings which helped to make
him, toward the end of his life, a wealthy man. Washington, who had
a keen eye for land values, became the owner of immense quantities
of real estate. In 1788 he already possessed two hundred thousand
acres. (De Warville, 243.)</p></div>

Seven thousand two hundred and thirty-four lots stood in his name
when the site of Washington was still a primeval forest. (Oberholtzer,
308-12.) Some of these he afterwards transferred to the Marshall
brothers, undoubtedly to make good his engagement to furnish the
money for the Fairfax deal, which his failure prevented him from advancing
entirely in cash. (For account of Morris's real estate transactions

mission was tendered Marshall, his father in Kentucky resigned the
office of Supervisor of Revenue for the District of Ohio. In his letter
of resignation Thomas Marshall gives a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of his experiences as
an official under Washington's Administrations. Since this is one of
the only two existing letters of Marshall's father on political subjects,
and because it may have turned Adams's mind to John Marshall,
it is worthy of reproduction:&mdash;
</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,
</p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having determined to resign my Commission as Supervisor of
the Revenue for the district of Ohio, on the 30th day of June next,
which terminates the present fiscal year, I have thought it right to
give this timely notice to you as President of the United States, in
whom the nomination and appointment of my successor is vested; in
order that you may in the meantime select some fit person to fill the
office. You will therefore be pleased to consider me as out of office on
the first day of July ensuing.
</p><p>
It may possibly be a subject of enquiry, why, after holding the
office during the most critical &amp; troublesome times, I should now
resign it, when I am no longer insulted, and abused, for endeavoring
to execute the Laws of my Country&mdash;when those Laws appear to be,
more than formerly, respected&mdash;and when the probability is, that in
future they may be carried into effect with but little difficulty?
</p><p>
In truth this very change, among other considerations, furnishes a
reason for the decision I have made. For having once engaged in the
business of revenue I presently found myself of sufficient importance
with the enemies of the Government here to be made an object of
their particular malevolence&mdash;and while this was the case, I was determined
not to be driven from my post.
</p><p>
At this time, advanced in years and declining in health, I find myself
unfit for the cares, and active duties of the office; and therefore
cheerfully resign a situation, which I at first accepted and afterwards
held, more from an attachment to the Government, than from any
pecuniary consideration, to be filled by some more active officer, as
still more conducive to the public service.
</p><p>
To the late President I had the honor of being known, and combined,
with respect and veneration for his public character, the more social
and ardent affections of the man, and of the friend.
</p><p>
You Sir I have not the honor to know personally, but you have filled
too many important stations in the service of your country; &amp; fame
has been too busy with your name to permit me to remain ignorant of
your character; for which in all its public relations permit me to say,
I feel the most entire respect and esteem: Nor is it to me among the
smallest motives for my rejoicing that you are the President; and of
my attachment to your administration to know that you have ever
been on terms of friendship with the late President&mdash;that you have
approved his administration,&mdash;and that you propose to yourself his
conduct as an example for your imitation.
</p><p>
On this occasion I may say without vanity that I have formerly and
not infrequently, given ample testimony of my attachment to Republican
Government, to the peace, liberty and happiness of my country
and that it is not now to be supposed that I have changed my principles&mdash;or
can esteem those who possess different ones.
</p><p>
And altho' I am too old [Thomas Marshall was nearly sixty-five
years of age when he wrote this letter] and infirm for active services,
(for which I pray our country may not feel a call) yet my voice shall
ever be excited in opposition to foreign influence, (from whence the
greatest danger seems to threaten, as well as against internal foes)
and in support of a manly, firm, and independent, exercise of those
constitutional rights, which belong to the President, and Government
of the United States. And, <i>even opinions</i>, have their effect.

(<i>Facsimile</i>)</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>
<p>So wrote John Marshall at the first stage of his
journey upon that critical diplomatic mission which
was to prove the most dramatic in our history and
which was to be the turning-point in Marshall's life.
From the time when Mary Ambler became his bride
in 1783, Marshall had never been farther away from
his Richmond home than Philadelphia, to which
city he had made three flying visits in 1796, one to
argue the British Debts case, the other two to see
Robert Morris on the Fairfax deal and to hasten
the decision of the Supreme Court in that controversy.</p>

<p>But now Marshall was to cross the ocean as one
of the American envoys to "the terrible Republic"
whose "power and vengeance" everybody dreaded.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
He was to go to that now arrogant Paris whose
streets were resounding with the shouts of French
victories. It was the first and the last trans-Atlantic
voyage Marshall ever undertook; and although he
was to sail into a murky horizon to grapple with vast
difficulties and unknown dangers, yet the mind of
the home-loving Virginian dwelt more on his Richmond
fireside than on the duties and hazards before
him.</p>

<p>Three days after his arrival at Philadelphia, impressionable
as a boy, he again writes to his wife:
"My dearest Polly I have been extremely chagrined
at not having yet received a letter from you. I hope
you are well as I hear nothing indicating the contrary
but you know not how solicitous how anxiously solicitous
I am to hear it from yourself. Write me that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
you are well &amp; in good spirits &amp; I shall set out on my
voyage with a lightened heart ... you will hear
from me more than once before my departure."</p>

<p>The Virginia envoy was much courted at Philadelphia
before he sailed. "I dined yesterday," Marshall
tells his wife, "in a very large company of
Senators &amp; members of the house of representatives
who met to celebrate the 4th of July. The company
was really a most respectable one &amp; I experienced
from them the most flattering attention. I have
much reason to be satisfied &amp; pleased with the
manner in which I am received here." But flattery
did not soothe Marshall&mdash;"Something is wanting
to make me happy," he tells his "dearest Polly."
"Had I my dearest wife with me I should be delighted
indeed."<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>Washington had sent letters in Marshall's care
to acquaintances in France commending him to
their attention and good offices; and the retired
President wrote Marshall himself a letter of hearty
good wishes. "Receive sir," replies Marshall, "my
warm &amp; grateful acknowledgments for the polite &amp;,
allow me to add, friendly wishes which you express
concerning myself as well as for the honor of being
mentioned in your letters."<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>A less composed man, totally unpracticed as Marshall
was in diplomatic usages, when embarking on
an adventure involving war or peace, would have
occupied himself constantly in preparing for the vast
business before him. Not so Marshall. While waiting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
for his ship, he indulged his love of the theater.
Again he tells his wife how much he misses her. "I
cannot avoid writing to you because while doing so I
seem to myself to be in some distant degree enjoying
your company. I was last night at the play &amp; saw the
celebrated Mrs. Mary in the character of Juliet. She
performs that part to admiration indeed but I really
do not think Mrs. Westig is far her inferior in it. I
saw," gossips Marshall, "Mrs. Heyward there. I
have paid that lady one visit to one of the most delightful
&amp; romantic spots on the river Schuylkil....
She expressed much pleasure to see me &amp; has
pressed me very much to repeat my visit. I hope I
shall not have time to do so."</p>

<p>Marshall is already bored with the social life of
Philadelphia. "I am beyond expression impatient
to set out on the embassy," he informs his wife. "The
life I lead here does not suit me I am weary of it I
dine out every day &amp; am now engaged longer I hope
than I shall stay. This dissipated life does not long
suit my temper. I like it very well for a day or two
but I begin to require a frugal repast with good cold
water"&mdash;There was too much wine, it would seem,
at Philadelphia to suit Marshall.</p>

<p>"I would give a great deal to dine with you to day
on a piece of cold meat with our boys beside us to
see Little Mary running backwards &amp; forwards over
the floor playing the sweet little tricks she [is]
full of.... I wish to Heaven the time which must
intervene before I can repass these delightful scenes
was now terminated &amp; that we were looking back on
our separation instead of seeing it before us. Fare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>well
my dearest Polly. Make yourself happy &amp; you
will bless your ever affectionate</p>

<p class="ralign">
"<span class="smcap">J. Marshall</span>."<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a><br />
</p>

<p>If Marshall was pleased with Adams, the President
was equally impressed with his Virginia envoy
to France. "He [Marshall] is a plain man very sensible,
cautious, guarded, and learned in the law of
nations.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> I think you will be pleased with him,"<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
Adams writes Gerry, who was to be Marshall's
associate and whose capacity for the task even his
intimate personal friend, the President, already distrusted.
Hamilton was also in Philadelphia at the
time<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>&mdash;a circumstance which may or may not have
been significant. It was, however, the first time, so
far as definite evidence attests, that these men had
met since they had been comrades and fellow officers
in the Revolution.</p>

<p>The "Aurora," the leading Republican newspaper,
was mildly sarcastic over Marshall's ignorance of the
French language and general lack of equipment for
his diplomatic task. "Mr. Marshall, one of our
extra envoys to France, will be eminently qualified
for the mission by the time he reaches that country,"
says the "Aurora." Some official of great legal
learning was coaching Marshall, it seems, and advised
him to read certain monarchical books on the
old France and on the fate of the ancient republics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Aurora" asks "whether some history of
France since the overthrow of the Monarchy would
not have been more instructive to Mr. Marshall.
The Envoy, however," continues the "Aurora,"
"approved the choice of his sagacious friend, but
very shrewdly observed 'that he must first purchase
Chambaud's grammar, English and French.' We
understand that he is a very apt scholar, and no
doubt, during the passage, he will be able to acquire
enough of the French jargon for all the purposes of
the embassy."<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>Having received thirty-five hundred dollars for
his expenses,<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Marshall set sail on the brig Grace
for Amsterdam where Charles Cotesworth Pinckney,
the expelled American Minister to France and
head of the mission, awaited him. As the land faded,
Marshall wrote, like any love-sick youth, another
letter to his wife which he sent back by the pilot.</p>

<p>"The land is just escaping from my view," writes
Marshall to his "dearest Polly"; "the pilot is about
to leave us &amp; I hasten from the deck into the cabin
once more to give myself the sweet indulgence of
writing to you.... There has been so little wind
that we are not yet entirely out of the bay. It is so
wide however that the land has the appearance of a
light blue cloud on the surface of the water &amp; we
shall very soon lose it entirely."</p>

<p>Marshall assures his wife that his "cabin is neat
&amp; clean. My berth a commodious one in which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
have my own bed &amp; sheets of which I have a plenty
so that I lodge as conveniently as I could do in any
place whatever &amp; I find I sleep very soundly altho
on water." He is careful to say that he has plenty of
creature comforts. "We have for the voyage, the
greatest plenty of salt provisions live stock &amp; poultry
&amp; as we lay in our own liquors I have taken care
to provide myself with a plenty of excellent porter
wine &amp; brandy. The Captain is one of the most
obliging men in the world &amp; the vessel is said by
every body to be a very fine one."</p>

<p>There were passengers, too, who suited Marshall's
sociable disposition and who were "well disposed to
make the voyage agreeable.... I have then my
dearest Polly every prospect before me of a passage
such as I could wish in every respect but one ...
fear of a lengthy passage. We have met in the bay
several vessels. One from Liverpool had been at sea
nine weeks, &amp; the others from other places had been
proportionately long.... I shall be extremely impatient
to hear from you &amp; our dear children."</p>

<p>Marshall tells his wife how to direct her letters to
him, "some ... by the way of London to the care of
Rufus King esquire our Minister there, some by the
way of Amsterdam or the Hague to the care of William
Vanns [<i>sic</i>] Murr[a]y esquire our Minister at the
Hague &amp; perhaps some directed to me as Envoy
extraordinary of the United States to the French
Republic at Paris.</p>

<p>"Do not I entreat you omit to write. Some of
your letters may miscarry but some will reach me &amp;
my heart can feel till my return no pleasure com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>parable
to what will be given it by a line from
you telling me that all remains well. Farewell my
dearest wife. Your happiness will ever be the first
prayer of your unceasingly affectionate</p>

<p class="ralign">
"<span class="smcap">J. Marshall</span>."<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a><br />
</p>

<p>So fared forth John Marshall upon the adventure
which was to open the door to that historic career
that lay just beyond it; and force him, against his will
and his life's plans, to pass through it. But for this
French mission, it is certain that Marshall's life would
have been devoted to his law practice and his private
affairs. He now was sailing to meet the ablest and
most cunning diplomatic mind in the contemporary
world whose talents, however, were as yet known
to but few; and to face the most venal and ruthless
governing body of any which then directed the
affairs of the nations of Europe. Unguessed and unexpected
by the kindly, na&iuml;ve, and inexperienced
Richmond lawyer were the scenes about to unroll
before him; and the manner of his meeting the emergencies
so soon to confront him was the passing of
the great divide in his destiny.</p>

<p>Even had the French rulers been perfectly honest
and simple men, the American envoys would have
had no easy task. For American-French affairs were
sadly tangled and involved. Gouverneur Morris, our
first Minister to France under the Constitution, had
made himself unwelcome to the French Revolutionists;
and to placate the authorities then reigning in
Paris, Washington had recalled Morris and appointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Monroe in his place "after several attempts had
failed to obtain a more eligible character."<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>Monroe, a partisan of the Revolutionists, had begun
his mission with theatrical blunders; and these
he continued until his recall,<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> when he climaxed his
imprudent conduct by his attack on Washington.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>
During most of his mission Monroe was under the
influence of Thomas Paine,<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> who had then become
the venomous enemy of Washington.</p>

<p>Monroe had refused to receive from his fellow
Minister to England, John Jay, "confidential informal
statements" as to the British treaty which
Jay prudently had sent him by word of mouth
only. When the Jay Treaty itself arrived, Monroe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
publicly denounced the treaty as "shameful,"<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> a
grave indiscretion in the diplomatic representative
of the Government that had negotiated the offending
compact.</p>

<p>Finally Monroe was recalled and Washington,
after having offered the French mission to John
Marshall, appointed Charles Cotesworth Pinckney
of South Carolina as his successor. The French
Revolutionary authorities had bitterly resented the
Jay compact, accused the American Government
of violating its treaty with France, denounced the
United States for ingratitude, and abused it for
undue friendship to Great Britain.</p>

<p>In all this the French Directory had been and still
was backed up by the Republicans in the United
States, who, long before this, had become a distinctly
French party. Thomas Paine understated the case
when he described "the Republican party in the
United States" as "that party which is the sincere
ally of France."<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>The French Republic was showing its resentment
by encouraging a piratical warfare by French privateers
upon American commerce. Indeed, vessels of
the French Government joined in these depredations.
In this way, it thought to frighten the United
States into taking the armed side of France against
Great Britain. The French Republic was emulating
the recent outrages of that Power; and, except that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the French did not impress Americans into their
service, as the British had done, their Government
was furnishing to America the same cause for war
that Great Britain had so brutally afforded.</p>

<p>In less than a year and a half before Marshall
sailed from Philadelphia, more than three hundred
and forty American vessels had been taken by French
privateers.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Over fifty-five million dollars' worth of
American property had been destroyed or confiscated
under the decrees of the Directory.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> American seamen,
captured on the high seas, had been beaten and
imprisoned. The officers and crew of a French armed
brig tortured Captain Walker, of the American ship
Cincinnatus, four hours by thumbscrews.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>When Monroe learned that Pinckney had been
appointed to succeed him, he began a course of insinuations
to his French friends against his successor;
branded Pinckney as an "aristocrat"; and
thus sowed the seeds for the insulting treatment the
latter received upon his appearance at the French
Capital.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Upon Pinckney's arrival, the French Directory
refused to receive him, threatened him with
arrest by the Paris police, and finally ordered the
new American Minister out of the territory of the
Republic.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>To emphasize this affront, the Directory made a
great ado over the departure of Monroe, who re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>sponded
with a characteristic address. To this
speech Barras, then President of the Directory, replied
in a harangue insulting to the American Government;
it was, indeed, an open appeal to the American
people to repudiate their own Administration,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
of the same character as, and no less offensive than,
the verbal performances of Gen&ecirc;t.</p>

<p>And still the outrages of French privateers on
American ships continued with increasing fury.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
The news of Pinckney's treatment and the speech
of Barras reached America after Adams's inauguration.
The President promptly called Congress into
a special session and delivered to the National Legislature
an address in which Adams appears at his
best.</p>

<p>The "refusal [by the Directory] ... to receive
him [Pinckney] until we had acceded to their demands
without discussion and without investigation,
is to treat us neither as allies nor as friends, nor
as a sovereign state," said the President; who continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The speech of the President [Barras] discloses
sentiments more alarming than the refusal of a
minister [Pinckney], because more dangerous to our
independence and union....</p>

<p>"It evinces a disposition to separate the people of
the United States from the government, to persuade
them that they have different affections, principles
and interests from those of their fellow citizens whom
they themselves have chosen to manage their com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>mon
concerns and thus to produce divisions fatal to
our peace.</p>

<p>"Such attempts ought to be repelled with a decision
which shall convince France and the world that
we are not a degraded people, humiliated under a
colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority, fitted
to be the miserable instruments of foreign influence,
and regardless of national honor, character, and
interest.</p>

<p>"I should have been happy to have thrown a veil
over these transactions if it had been possible to
conceal them; but they have passed on the great
theatre of the world, in the face of all Europe and
America, and with such circumstances of publicity
and solemnity that they cannot be disguised and will
not soon be forgotten. They have inflicted a wound
in the American breast. It is my sincere desire, however,
that it may be healed."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so anxious was President Adams for
peace that he informed Congress: "I shall institute
a fresh attempt at negotiation.... If we have
committed errors, and these can be demonstrated,
we shall be willing to correct them; if we have done
injuries, we shall be willing on conviction to redress
them; and equal measures of justice we have
a right to expect from France and every other nation."<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>Adams took this wise action against the judgment
of the Federalist leaders,<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> who thought that, since
the outrages upon American commerce had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
committed by France and the formal insult to our
Minister had been perpetrated by France, the advances
should come from the offending Government.
Technically, they were right; practically, they were
wrong. Adams's action was sound as well as noble
statesmanship.</p>

<p>Thus came about the extraordinary mission, of
which Marshall was a member, to adjust our differences
with the French Republic. The President
had taken great care in selecting the envoys. He
had considered Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison,<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>
for this delicate and fateful business; but the two latter,
for reasons of practical politics, would not serve,
and without one of them, Hamilton's appointment
was impossible. Pinckney, waiting at Amsterdam,
was, of course, to head the commission. Finally
Adams's choice fell on John Marshall of Virginia
and Francis Dana, Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court of Massachusetts; and these nominations were
confirmed by the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>But Dana declined,<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> and, against the unanimous
advice of his Cabinet,<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> Adams then nominated Elbridge
Gerry, who, though a Republican, had, on
account of their personal relations, voted for Adams
for President, apologizing, however, most humbly to
Jefferson for having done so.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>No appointment could have better pleased that
unrivaled politician. Gerry was in general agree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>ment
with Jefferson and was, temperamentally, an
easy instrument for craft to play upon. When Gerry
hesitated to accept, Jefferson wrote his "dear
friend" that "it was with infinite joy to me that you
were yesterday announced to the Senate" as one of
the envoys; and he pleaded with Gerry to undertake
the mission.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>The leaders of the President's party in Congress
greatly deplored the selection of Gerry. "No appointment
could ... have been more injudicious,"
declared Sedgwick.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> "If, sir, it was a desirable thing
to distract the mission, a fitter person could not,
perhaps, be found. It is ten to one against his agreeing
with his colleagues," the Secretary of War advised
the President.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Indeed, Adams himself was
uneasy about Gerry, and in a prophetic letter sought
to forestall the very indiscretions which the latter
afterwards committed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 860px;">

<span class="caption">PART OF LETTER OF JULY 17, 1797, FROM JOHN ADAMS TO ELBRIDGE GERRY DESCRIBING JOHN MARSHALL<br />
(<i>Facsimile</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>"There is the utmost necessity for harmony, complaisance,
and condescension among the three envoys,
and unanimity is of great importance," the
President cautioned Gerry. "It is," said Adams,
"my sincere desire that an accommodation may
take place; but our national faith, and the honor
of our government, cannot be sacrificed. You have
known enough of the unpleasant effects of disunion
among ministers to convince you of the necessity of
avoiding it, like a rock or quicksand.... It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>probable there will be man&#339;uvres practiced to excite
jealousies among you."<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p>Forty-eight days after Marshall took ship at
Philadelphia, he arrived at The Hague.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> The long
voyage had been enlivened by the sight of many
vessels and the boarding of Marshall's ship three
times by British men-of-war.</p>

<p>"Until our arrival in Holland," Marshall writes
Washington, "we saw only British &amp; neutral vessels.
This added to the blockade of the dutch fleet in
the Texel, of the french fleet in Brest &amp; of the spanish
fleet in Cadiz, manifests the entire dominion
which one nation [Great Britain] at present possesses
over the seas.</p>

<p>"By the ships of war which met us we were three
times visited &amp; the conduct of those who came on
board was such as wou'd proceed from general orders
to pursue a system calculated to conciliate America.</p>

<p>"Whether this be occasion'd by a sense of justice
&amp; the obligations of good faith, or solely by the
hope that the perfect contrast which it exhibits to
the conduct of France may excite keener sensations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
at that conduct, its effects on our commerce is the
same."<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>It was a momentous hour in French history when
the Virginian landed on European soil. The French
elections of 1797 had given to the conservatives a
majority in the National Assembly, and the Directory
was in danger. The day after Marshall reached
the Dutch Capital, the troops sent by Bonaparte,
that young eagle, his pinions already spread for his
imperial flight, achieved the revolution of the 18th
Fructidor (4th of September); gave the ballot-shaken
Directory the support of bayonets; made it,
in the end, the jealous but trembling tool of the
youthful conqueror; and armed it with a power
through which it nullified the French elections and
cast into prison or drove into exile all who came
under its displeasure or suspicion.</p>

<p>With Lodi, Arcola, and other laurels upon his
brow, the Corsican already had begun his astonishing
career as dictator of terms to Europe. The
native Government of the Netherlands had been
replaced by one modeled on the French system;
and the Batavian Republic, erected by French arms,
had become the vassal and the tool of Revolutionary
France.</p>

<p>Three days after his arrival at The Hague, Marshall
writes his wife of the safe ending of his voyage
and how "very much pleased" he is with Pinckney,
whom he "immediately saw." They were waiting
"anxiously" for Gerry, Marshall tells her. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
shall wait a week or ten days longer &amp; shall then
proceed on our journey [to Paris]. You cannot conceive
(yes you can conceive) how these delays perplex
&amp; mortify me. I fear I cannot return until the
spring &amp; that fear excites very much uneasiness &amp;
even regret at my having ever consented to cross the
Atlantic. I wish extremely to hear from you &amp; to
know your situation. My mind clings so to Richmond
that scarcely a night passes in which during
the hours of sleep I have not some interesting conversation
with you or concerning you."</p>

<p>Marshall tells his "dearest Polly" about the appearance
of The Hague, its walks, buildings, and "a
very extensive wood adjoining the city which extends
to the sea," and which is "the pride &amp; boast of
the place." "The society at the Hague is probably
very difficult, to an American it certainly is, &amp; I
have no inclination to attempt to enter into it. While
the differences with France subsist the political characters
of this place are probably unwilling to be
found frequently in company with our countrymen.
It might give umbrage to France." Pinckney had
with him his wife and daughter, "who," writes Marshall,
"appears to be about 12 or 13 years of age.
Mrs. Pinckney informs me that only one girl of her
age has visited her since the residence of the family
at the Hague.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> In fact we seem to have no communication
but with Americans, or those who are
employed by America or who have property in our
country."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>While at The Hague, Marshall yields, as usual, to
his love for the theater, although he cannot understand
a word of the play. "Near my lodgings is a
theatre in which a french company performs three
times a week," he tells his wife. "I have been frequently
to the play &amp; tho' I do not understand the
language I am very much amused at it. The whole
company is considered as having a great deal of
merit but there is a Madame de Gazor who is considered
as one of the first performers in Paris who
bears the palm in the estimation of every person."</p>

<p>Marshall narrates to his wife the result of the
<i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> of September 4. "The Directory," he
writes, "with the aid of the soldiery have just put in
arrest the most able &amp; leading members of the legislature
who were considered as moderate men &amp;
friends of peace. Some conjecture that this event
will so abridge our negotiations as probably to occasion
my return to America this fall. A speedy return
is my most ardent wish but to have my return
expedited by the means I have spoken of is a circumstance
so calamitous that I deprecate it as the
greatest of evils. Remember me affectionately to
our friends &amp; kiss for me our dear little Mary. Tell
the boys how much I expect from them &amp; how anxious
I am to see them as well as their beloved mother.
I am my dearest Polly unalterably your</p>

<p class="ralign">
"<span class="smcap">J Marshall</span>."<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a><br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>The theaters and other attractions of The Hague
left Marshall plenty of time, however, for serious
and careful investigations. The result of these he
details to Washington. The following letter shows
not only Marshall's state of mind just before starting
for Paris, but also the effect of European conditions
upon him and how strongly they already were confirming
Marshall's tendency of thought so firmly
established by every event of his life since our War
for Independence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tho' the face of the country [Holland] still exhibits
a degree of wealth &amp; population perhaps unequal'd
in any other part of Europe, its decline is
visible. The great city of Amsterdam is in a state of
blockade. More than two thirds of its shipping lie
unemploy'd in port. Other seaports suffer tho' not in
so great a degree. In the meantime the requisitions
made [by the French] upon them [the Dutch] are
enormous....</p>

<p>"It is supposed that France has by various means
drawn from Holland about 60,000,000 of dollars.
This has been paid, in addition to the national expenditures,
by a population of less than 2,000,000....
Not even peace can place Holland in her former
situation. Antwerp will draw from Amsterdam
a large portion of that commerce which is the great
source of its wealth; for Antwerp possesses, in the
existing state of things, advantages which not even
weight of capital can entirely surmount."</p>

<p>Marshall then gives Washington a clear and striking
account of the political happenings among the
Dutch under French domination:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"The political divisions of this country &amp; its uncertainty
concerning its future destiny must also
have their operation....</p>

<p>"A constitution which I have not read, but which
is stated to me to have contain'd all the great fundamentals
of a representative government, &amp; which
has been prepar'd with infinite labor, &amp; has experienc'd
an uncommon length of discussion was rejected
in the primary assemblies by a majority of
nearly five to one of those who voted....</p>

<p>"The substitute wish'd for by its opponents is a
legislature with a single branch having power only
to initiate laws which are to derive their force from
the sanction of the primary assemblies. I do not
know how they wou'd organize it.... It is remarkable
that the very men who have rejected the form
of government propos'd to them have re&euml;lected a
great majority of the persons who prepar'd it &amp; will
probably make from it no essential departure....
It is worthy of notice that more than two thirds of
those entitled to suffrage including perhaps more
than four fifths of the property of the nation &amp; who
wish'd, as I am told, the adoption of the constitution,
withheld their votes....</p>

<p>"Many were restrain'd by an unwillingness to
take the oath required before a vote could be receiv'd;
many, disgusted with the present state of
things, have come to the unwise determination of
revenging themselves on those whom they charge
with having occasion'd it by taking no part whatever
in the politics of their country, &amp; many seem
to be indifferent to every consideration not im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>mediately
connected with their particular employments."</p>

<p>Holland's example made the deepest impression
on Marshall's mind. What he saw and heard fortified
his already firm purpose not to permit America,
if he could help it, to become the subordinate or
ally of any foreign power. The concept of the American
people as a separate and independent Nation
unattached to, unsupported by, and unafraid of any
other country, which was growing rapidly to be the
passion of Marshall's life, was given fresh force by
the humiliation and distress of the Dutch under
French control.</p>

<p>"The political opinions which have produc'd the
rejection of the constitution," Marshall reasons in
his report to Washington, "&amp; which, as it wou'd
seem, can only be entertain'd by intemperate &amp; ill
inform'd minds unaccustom'd to a union of the theory
&amp; practice of liberty, must be associated with a general
system which if brought into action will produce
the same excesses here which have been so
justly deplor'd in France.</p>

<p>"The same materials exist tho' not in so great a
degree. They have their clubs, they have a numerous
poor &amp; they have enormous wealth in the hands
of a minority of the nation."</p>

<p>Marshall interviewed Dutch citizens, in his casual,
indolent, and charming way; and he thus relates to
Washington the sum of one such conversation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On my remarking this to a very rich &amp; intelligent
merchant of Amsterdam &amp; observing that if
one class of men withdrew itself from public duties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
&amp; offices it wou'd immediately be succeeded by another
which wou'd acquire a degree of power &amp; influence
that might be exercis'd to the destruction
of those who had retir'd from society, he replied that
the remark was just, but that they relied on France
for a protection from those evils which she had herself
experienc'd. That France wou'd continue to require
great supplies from Holland &amp; knew its situation
too well to permit it to become the prey of
anarchy.</p>

<p>"That Holland was an artificial country acquired
by persevering industry &amp; which cou'd only be preserv'd
by wealth &amp; order. That confusion &amp; anarchy
wou'd banish a large portion of that wealth, wou'd
dry up its sources &amp; wou'd entirely disable them
from giving France that pecuniary aid she so much
needed. That under this impression very many who
tho' friends to the revolution, saw with infinite mortification
french troops garrison the towns of Holland,
wou'd now see their departure with equal
regret.</p>

<p>"Thus, they willingly relinquish national independence
for individual safety. What a lesson to
those who wou'd admit foreign influence into the
United States!"</p>

<p>Marshall then narrates the events in France which
followed the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> of September 4. While this
account is drawn from rumors and newspapers and
therefore contains a few errors, it is remarkable on
the whole for its general accuracy. No condensation
can do justice to Marshall's review of this period
of French history in the making. It is of first im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>portance,
also, as disclosing his opinions of the
Government he was so soon to encounter and his
convictions that unrestrained liberty must result in
despotism.</p>

<p>"You have observed the storm which has been
long gathering in Paris," continues Marshall. "The
thunderbolt has at length been launch'd at the heads
of the leading members of the legislature &amp; has, it is
greatly to be fear'd, involv'd in one common ruin
with them, the constitution &amp; liberties of their country....
Complete &amp; impartial details concerning it
will not easily be obtained as the press is no longer
free. The journalists who had ventur'd to censure the
proceedings of a majority of the directory are seiz'd,
&amp; against about forty of them a sentence of transportation
is pronounced.</p>

<p>"The press is plac'd under the superintendence of
a police appointed by &amp; dependent on the executive.
It is supposed that all private letters have been
seiz'd for inspection.</p>

<p>"From some Paris papers it appears, that on the
first alarm, several members of the legislature attempted
to assemble in their proper halls which
they found clos'd &amp; guarded by an arm'd force.
Sixty or seventy assembled at another place &amp; began
to remonstrate against the violence offer'd to their
body, but fear soon dispersed them.</p>

<p>"To destroy the possibility of a rallying point the
municipal administrations of Paris &amp; the central
administration of the seine were immediately suspended
&amp; forbidden by an arr&ecirc;t&eacute; of the directoire,
to assemble themselves together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Many of the administrators of the departments
through France elected by the people, had been
previously remov'd &amp; their places filled by persons
chosen by the directory....</p>

<p>"The fragment of the legislature convok'd by the
directory at L'Od&eacute;on &amp; L'&eacute;cole de sant&eacute;, hasten'd to
repeal the law for organizing the national guards, &amp;
authoriz'd the directory to introduce into Paris as
many troops as shou'd be judg'd necessary. The
same day the liberty of the press was abolish'd by a
line, property taken away by another &amp; personal
security destroy'd by a sentence of transportation
against men unheard &amp; untried.</p>

<p>"All this," sarcastically remarks Marshall, "is
still the triumph of liberty &amp; of the constitution."</p>

<p>Although admitting his lack of official information,
Marshall "briefly" observes that: "Since the
election of the new third, there were found in both
branches of the legislature a majority in favor of
moderate measures &amp; apparently, wishing sincerely
for peace. They have manifested a disposition which
threaten'd a condemnation of the conduct of the
directory towards America, a scrutiny into the
transactions of Italy, particularly those respecting
Venice &amp; Genoa, an enquiry into the disposition of
public money &amp; such a regular arrangement of the
finances as wou'd prevent in future those dilapidations
which are suspected to have grown out of their
disorder. They [French conservatives] have sought
too by their laws to ameliorate the situation of those
whom terror had driven out of France, &amp; of those
priests who had committed no offense."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall thus details to Washington the excuse
of the French radicals for their severe treatment of
the conservatives:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The cry of a conspiracy to re&euml;stablish royalism
was immediately rais'd against them [conservatives].
An envoy was dispatched to the Army of Italy to
sound its disposition. It was represented that the
legislature was hostile to the armies, that it withheld
their pay &amp; subsistence, that by its opposition
to the directory it encourag'd Austria &amp; Britain to
reject the terms of peace which were offer'd by
France &amp; which but for that opposition wou'd have
been accepted, &amp; finally that it had engag'd in a conspiracy
for the destruction of the constitution &amp; the
republic &amp; for the restoration of royalty.</p>

<p>"At a feast given to the armies of Italy to commemorate
their fellow soldiers who had fallen in that
country the Generals address'd to them their complaints,
plainly spoke of marching to Paris to support
the directory against the councils &amp; received
from them addresses manifesting the willingness of
the soldiers to follow them.</p>

<p>"The armies also addressed the directory &amp; each
other, &amp; addresses were dispatched to different departments.
The directory answer'd them by the
stronge[st] criminations of the legislature. Similar
proceedings were had in the army of the interior
commanded by Gen<sup>l&#803;</sup> Hoche. Detachments were
mov'd within the limits prohibited by the constitution,
some of which declar'd they were marching to
Paris 'to bring the legislature to reason.'"</p>

<p>Here follows Marshall's story of what then hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>pened,
according to the accounts which were given
him at The Hague:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alarm'd at these movements the council of five
hundred call'd on the directory for an account of
them. The movement of the troops within the constitutional
circle was attributed to accident &amp; the
discontents of the army to the faults committed by
the legislature who were plainly criminated as conspirators
against the army &amp; the republic.</p>

<p>"This message was taken up by Tron&ccedil;on in the
council of antients &amp; by Thibideau in the council of
five hundred. I hope you have seen their speeches.
They are able, &amp; seem to me entirely exculpated the
legislature.</p>

<p>"In the mean time the directory employed itself
in the removal of the administrators of many of the
departments &amp; cantons &amp; replacing those whom the
people had elected by others in whom it cou'd confide,
and in the removal generally of such officers
both civil &amp; military as cou'd not be trusted to make
room for others on whom it cou'd rely.</p>

<p>"The legislature on its part, pass'd several laws
to enforce the constitutional restrictions on the
armies &amp; endeavored to organize the national guards.
On this latter subject especially Pichegru, great &amp;
virtuous I believe in the cabinet as in the field, was
indefatigable. We understand that the day before
the law for their organization wou'd have been carried
into execution the decisive blow was struck."</p>

<p>Marshall now relates, argumentatively, the facts as
he heard them in the Dutch Capital; and in doing so,
reveals his personal sentiments and prejudices:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"To support the general charge of conspiracy in
favor of royalty I know of no particular facts alleged
against the arrested Members except Pichegru
&amp; two or three others.... Pichegru is made in the
first moment of conversation to unbosom himself
entirely to a perfect stranger who had only told him
that he came from the Prince of Conde &amp; cou'd not
exhibit a single line of testimonial of any sort to
prove that he had ever seen that Prince or that he
was not a spy employ'd by some of the enemies of
the General.</p>

<p>"This story is repel'd by Pichegru's character
which has never before been defil'd. Great as were
the means he possess'd of personal aggrandizement
he retir'd clean handed from the army without adding
a shilling to his private fortune. It is repel'd by
his resigning the supreme command, by his numerous
victories subsequent to the alleged treason, by
its own extreme absurdity &amp; by the fear which his
accusers show of bringing him to trial according to
the constitution even before a tribunal they can influence
&amp; overawe, or of even permitting him to be
heard before the prostrate body which is still term'd
the legislature &amp; which in defiance of the constitution
has pronounc'd judgment on him.</p>

<p>"Yet this improbable &amp; unsupported tale seems
to be receiv'd as an established truth by those who
the day before [his] fall bow'd to him as an idol. I
am mortified as a man to learn that even his old
army which conquer'd under him, which ador'd him,
which partook of his fame &amp; had heretofore not
join'd their brethren in accusing the legislature, now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
unite in bestowing on him the heaviest execrations
&amp; do not hesitate to pronounce him a traitor of the
deepest die."</p>

<p>Irrespective of the real merits of the controversy,
Marshall tells Washington that he is convinced that
constitutional liberty is dead or dying in France:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whether this conspiracy be real or not," he says,
"the wounds inflicted on the constitution by the
three directors seem to me to be mortal. In opposition
to the express regulations of the constitution the
armies have deliberated, the result of their deliberations
addressed to the directory has been favorably
received &amp; the legislature since the revolution has
superadded its thanks.</p>

<p>"Troops have been marched within those limits
which by the constitution they are forbidden to
enter but on the request of the legislature. The directory
is forbidden to arrest a member of the legislature
unless in the very commission of a criminal
act &amp; then he can only be tried by the high court, on
which occasion forms calculated to protect his person
from violence or the prejudice of the moment are
carefully prescrib'd.</p>

<p>"Yet it has seized, by a military force, about fifty
leading members not taken in a criminal act &amp; has
not pursued a single step mark'd out by the constitution.
The councils can inflict no penalty on their
own members other than reprimand, arrest for
eight &amp; imprisonment for three days. Yet they have
banished to such places as the directory shall chuse
a large portion of their body without the poor formality
of hearing a defense.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"The legislature shall not exercise any judiciary
power or pass any retrospective law. Yet it has
pronounc'd this heavy judgment on others as well
as its own members &amp; has taken from individuals
property which the law has vested in them."</p>

<p>Marshall is already bitter against the Directory
because of its violation of the French Constitution,
and tells Washington:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The members of the directory are personally
secur'd by the same rules with those of the legislature.
Yet three directors have depriv'd two of their
places, the legislature has then banished them without
a hearing &amp; has proceeded to fill up the alledg'd
vacancies. Merlin late minister of justice &amp; Fran&ccedil;ois
de Neufchatel have been elected.</p>

<p>"The constitution forbids the house of any man
to be entered in the night. The orders of the constituted
authorities can only be executed in the day.
Yet many of the members were seiz'd in their
beds.</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, the constitution has been violated in
so many instances that it wou'd require a pamphlet
to detail them. The detail wou'd be unnecessary for
the great principle seems to be introduc'd that the
government is to be administered according to the
will of the nation."</p>

<p>Marshall now indulges in his characteristic eloquence
and peculiar method of argument:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Necessity, the never to be worn out apology for
violence, is alledg'd&mdash;but cou'd that necessity go
further than to secure the persons of the conspirators?
Did it extend to the banishment of the print<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>ers
&amp; to the slavery of the press? If such a necessity
did exist it was created by the disposition of the people
at large &amp; it is a truth which requires no demonstration
that if a republican form of government cannot
be administered by the general will, it cannot
be administered against that will by an army."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, hope for constitutional liberty in
France lingers in his heart in spite of this melancholy
recital.</p>

<p>"After all, the result may not be what is apprehended.
France possesses such enormous power,
such internal energy, such a vast population that she
may possibly spare another million &amp; preserve or
reacquire her liberty. Or, the form of the government
being preserved, the independence of the legislature
may be gradually recover'd.</p>

<p>"With their form of government or resolutions we
have certainly no right to intermeddle, but my regrets
at the present state of things are increased by
an apprehension that the rights of our country will
not be deem'd so sacred under the existing system as
they wou'd have been had the legislature preserved
its legitimate authority."<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>Washington's reply, which probably reached
Marshall some time after the latter's historic letter
to Talleyrand in January, 1798,<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> is informing.
He "prays for a continuance" of such letters and
hopes he will be able to congratulate Marshall "on
the favorable conclusion of your embassy.... To
predict the contrary might be as unjust as it is im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>politic,
and therefore," says Washington, "mum&mdash;on
that topic. Be the issue what it may," he is sure
"that nothing which justice, sound reasoning, and
fair representation would require will be wanting to
render it just and honorable." If so, and the mission
fails, "then the eyes of all who are not willfully
blind ... will be fully opened." The Directory
will have a rude awakening, if they expect the Republicans
to support France against America in the
"dernier ressort.... For the mass of our citizens
require no more than to understand a question to
decide it properly; and an adverse conclusion of the
negotiation will effect this." Washington plainly
indicates that he wishes Marshall to read his letter
between the lines when he says: "I shall dwell very
little on European politics ... because this letter may
pass through many hands."<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p>Gerry not arriving by September 18, Marshall and
Pinckney set out for Paris, "proceeding slowly in the
hope of being overtaken" by their tardy associate.
From Antwerp Marshall writes Charles Lee, then
Attorney-General, correcting some unimportant
statements in his letter to Washington, which, when
written, were "considered as certainly true," but
which "subsequent accounts contradict."<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> Down-heartedly
he says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our insulted injured country has not before it
the most flattering prospects. There is no circumstance
calculated to flatter us with the hope that our
negotiations will terminate as they ought to do....
We understand that all is now quiet in France,
the small show of resistance against which Napoleon
march'd is said to have dispersed on hearing of his
movement."</p>

<p>He then describes the celebration in Antwerp of
the birth of the new French r&eacute;gime:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-day being the anniversary of the foundation
of the Republic, was celebrated with great pomp
by the military at this place. Very few indeed of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>inhabitants attended the celebration. Everything
in Antwerp wears the appearance of consternation
and affright.</p>

<p>"Since the late revolution a proclamation has been
published forbidding any priest to officiate who has
not taken the oath prescribed by a late order. No
priest at Antwerp has taken it &amp; yesterday commenced
the suspension of their worship.</p>

<p>"All the external marks of their religion too with
which their streets abound are to be taken down.
The distress of the people at the calamity is almost
as great as if the town was to be given up to
pillage."<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>Five days after leaving Antwerp, Marshall and
Pinckney arrived in the French Capital. The Paris
of that time was still very much the Paris of Richelieu,
except for some large buildings and other improvements
begun by Louis XIV. The French metropolis
was in no sense a modern city and bore
little resemblance to the Paris of the present day.
Not until some years afterward did Napoleon as
Emperor begin the changes which later, under Napoleon
III, transformed it into the most beautiful
city in the world. Most of its ancient interest, as
well as its medi&aelig;val discomforts, were in existence
when Marshall and Pinckney reached their destination.</p>

<p>The Government was, in the American view, incredibly
corrupt, and the lack of integrity among the
rulers was felt even among the people. "The venal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>ity
is such," wrote Gouverneur Morris, in 1793,
"that if there be no traitor it is because the enemy
has not common sense."<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> And again: "The ...
administration is occupied in acquiring wealth."<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
Honesty was unknown, and, indeed, abhorrent, to
most of the governing officials; and the moral sense
of the citizens themselves had been stupefied by
the great sums of money which Bonaparte extracted
from conquered cities and countries and sent to the
treasury at Paris. Time and again the Republic was
saved from bankruptcy by the spoils of conquest;
and long before the American envoys set foot in
Paris the popular as well as the official mind had
come to expect the receipt of money from any source
or by any means.</p>

<p>The bribery of ministers of state and of members
of the Directory was a matter of course;<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> and
weaker countries paid cash for treaties with the
arrogant Government and purchased peace with a
price. During this very year Portugal was forced
to advance a heavy bribe to Talleyrand and the
Directory before the latter would consent to negotiate
concerning a treaty; and, as a secret part of
the compact, Portugal was required to make a
heavy loan to France. It was, indeed, a part of this
very Portuguese money with which the troops were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
brought to Paris for the September revolution of
1797.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>Marshall and Pinckney at once notified the French
Foreign Office of their presence, but delayed presenting
their letters of credence until Gerry should join
them before proceeding to business. A week passed;
and Marshall records in his diary that every day the
waiting envoys were besieged by "Americans whose
vessels had been captured &amp; condemned. By appeals
&amp; other dilatory means the money had been
kept out of the hands of the captors &amp; they were now
waiting on expenses in the hope that our [the envoys']
negotiations might relieve them."<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> A device,
this, the real meaning of which was to be made
plain when the hour should come to bring it to bear
on the American envoys.</p>

<p>Such was the official and public atmosphere in
which Marshall and Pinckney found themselves on
their mission to adjust, with honor, the differences
between France and America: a network of unofficial
and secret agents was all about them; and at its
center was the master spider, Talleyrand. The unfrocked
priest had been made Foreign Minister under
the Directory in the same month and almost the day
that Marshall embarked at Philadelphia for Paris.
It largely was through the efforts and influence of
Madame de Sta&euml;l<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> that this prince of intriguers was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
able to place his feet upon this first solid step of his
amazing career.</p>

<p>Talleyrand's genius was then unknown to the
world, and even the Directory at that time had
no inkling of his uncanny craft. To be sure, his
previous life had been varied and dramatic and
every page of it stamped with ability; but in the
tremendous and flaming events of that tragic period
he had not attracted wide attention. Now, at last,
Talleyrand had his opportunity.</p>

<p>Among other incidents of his life had been his
exile to America. For nearly two years and a half he
had lived in the United States, traveling hither and
yon through the forming Nation. Washington as
President had refused to receive the expelled Frenchman,
who never forgave the slight. In his journey
from State to State he had formed a poor opinion of
the American people. "If," he wrote, "I have to
stay here another year I shall die."<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>The incongruities of what still was pioneer life,
the illimitable forests, the confusion and strife of
opinion, the absence of National spirit and general
purpose, caused Talleyrand to look with contempt
upon the wilderness Republic. But most of all, this
future master spirit of European diplomacy was
impressed with what seemed to him the sordid,
money-grubbing character of the American people.
Nowhere did he find a spark of that idealism which
had achieved our independence; and he concluded
that gold was the American god.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>Fauchet's disclosures<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> had caused official Paris
to measure the American character by the same
yardstick that Talleyrand applied to us, when, on
leaving our shores, he said: "The United States
merit no more consideration than Genoa or Gen&egrave;ve."<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>The French Foreign Minister was not fairly established
when the American affair came before him.
Not only was money his own pressing need, but to
pander to the avarice of his master Barras and the
other corrupt members of the Directory was his
surest method of strengthening his, as yet, uncertain
official position. Such were Talleyrand's mind, views,
and station, when, three days after Gerry's belated
arrival, the newly installed Minister received the
American envoys informally at his house, "where his
office was held." By a curious freak of fate, they
found him closeted with the Portuguese Minister
from whom the very conditions had been exacted
which Talleyrand so soon was to attempt to extort
from the Americans.</p>

<p>It was a striking group&mdash;Talleyrand, tall and
thin of body, with pallid, shrunken cheeks and slumberous
eyes, shambling forward with a limp, as,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
with halting speech,<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> he coldly greeted his diplomatic
visitors; Gerry, small, erect, perfectly attired, the
owl-like solemnity of his face made still heavier by
his long nose and enormous wig; Pinckney, handsome,
well-dressed, clear-eyed, of open countenance;<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>
and Marshall, tall, lean, loose-jointed, carelessly
appareled, with only his brilliant eyes to hint at
the alert mind and dominant personality of the
man.</p>

<p>Talleyrand measured his adversaries instantly.
Gerry he had known in America and he weighed
with just balance the qualities of the Massachusetts
envoy; Pinckney he also had observed and feared
nothing from the blunt, outspoken, and transparently
honest but not in the least subtle or far-seeing
South Carolinian; the ill-appearing Virginian, of
whom he had never heard, Talleyrand counted as
a cipher. It was here that this keen and cynical
student of human nature blundered.</p>

<p>Marshall and Talleyrand were almost of an age,<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
the Frenchman being only a few months older than
his Virginia antagonist. The powers of neither were
known to the other, as, indeed, they were at that
time unguessed generally by the mass of the people,
even of their own countries.</p>

<span class="caption">TALLEYRAND</span>
</div>

<p>A month after Talleyrand became the head of
French Foreign Affairs, Rufus King, then our Minister
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>at London, as soon as he had heard of the
appointment of the American envoys, wrote Talleyrand
a conciliatory letter congratulating the
French diplomat upon his appointment. King and
Talleyrand had often met both in England and
America.</p>

<p>"We have been accustomed," writes King, "to
converse on every subject with the greatest freedom";
then, assuming the frankness of friendship,
King tries to pave the way for Marshall, Pinckney,
and Gerry, without mentioning the latter, however.
"From the moment I heard that you had
been named to the Department of Foreign Affairs,"
King assures Talleyrand, "I have felt a satisfactory
Confidence that the Cause of the increasing Misunderstanding
between us would cease, and that the
overtures mediated by our Government would not
fail to restore Harmony and Friendship between the
two Countries."<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>King might have saved his ink. Talleyrand did
not answer the letter; it is doubtful whether he even
read it. At any rate, King's somewhat amateurish
effort to beguile the French Foreign Minister by
empty words utterly failed of its purpose.</p>

<p>The Americans received cold comfort from Talleyrand;
he was busy, he said, on a report on Franco-American
affairs asked for by the Directory; when
he had presented it to his superiors he would, he said,
let the Americans know "what steps were to follow."
Talleyrand saw to it, however, that the envoys
received "cards of hospitality" which had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
denied to Pinckney. These saved the Americans at
least from offensive attentions from the police.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>Three days later, a Mr. Church, an American-born
French citizen, accompanied by his son, called on
Gerry, but found Marshall, who was alone. From
Thomas Paine, Church had learned of plans of the
Directory concerning neutrals which, he assured
Marshall, "would be extremely advantageous to the
United States." "Do not urge your mission now,"
suggested Church&mdash;the present was "a most unfavorable
moment." Haste meant that "all would
probably be lost." What were these measures of
the Directory? asked Marshall. Church was not at
liberty to disclose them, he said; but the envoys'
"true policy was to wait for events."</p>

<p>That night came a letter from the author of
"Common Sense." "This letter," Marshall records,
"made very different impressions on us. I
thought it an insult which ought to be received with
that coldness which would forbid the repetition of
it. Mr. Gerry was of a contrary opinion." Marshall
insisted that the Directory knew of Paine's letter
and would learn of the envoys' answer, and that
Pinckney, Gerry, and himself must act only as they
knew the American Government would approve.
It was wrong, said he, and imprudent to lead the
Directory to expect anything else from the envoys;
and Paine's "aspersions on our government"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
should be resented.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> So began the break between
Marshall and Gerry, which, considering the characters
of the two men, was inevitable.</p>

<p>Next, Talleyrand's confidential secretary confided
to Major Mountflorence, of the American Consulate,
that the Directory would require explanations
of President Adams's speech to Congress, by
which they were exasperated. The Directory would
not receive the envoys, he said, until the negotiations
were over; but that persons would be appointed
"to treat with" the Americans, and that
these agents would report to Talleyrand, who would
have "charge of the negotiations."<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> Mountflorence,
of course, so advised the envoys.</p>

<p>Thus the curtain rose upon the melodrama now
to be enacted&mdash;an episode without a parallel in
the history of American diplomacy. To understand
what follows, we must remember that the envoys
were governed by careful, lengthy, and detailed
instructions to the effect that "no blame or censure
be directly, or indirectly, imputed to the United
States"; that in order not to "wound her [France]
feelings or to excite her resentment" the negotiations
were to be on the principles of the British Treaty;
"that no engagement be made inconsistent with ...
any prior treaty"; that "no restraint on our lawful
commerce with any other nation be admitted"; that
nothing be done "incompatible with the complete
sovereignty and independence of the United States
in matters of policy, commerce, and government";<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
and "<i>that no aid be stipulated in favor of France during
the present war</i>."<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p>We are now to witness the acts in that strange
play, known to American history as the X. Y. Z.
Mission, as theatrical a spectacle as any ever prepared
for the stage. Indeed, the episode differs from
a performance behind the footlights chiefly in that
in this curious arrangement the explanation comes
after the acting is over. When the dispatches to
the American Government, which Marshall now is
to write, were transmitted to Congress, diplomatic
prudence caused the names of leading characters
to be indicated only by certain letters of the alphabet.
Thus, this determining phase of our diplomatic
history is known to the present day as "The X. Y. Z.
Affair."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_591_591" id="Footnote_591_591"></a><a href="#FNanchor_591_591"><span class="label">[591]</span></a> To justify the violence of the 18th Fructidor, the Directory asserted
that the French elections, in which a majority of conservatives
and anti-revolutionists were returned and General Pichegru chosen
President of the French Legislature, were parts of a royal conspiracy
to destroy liberty and again place a king upon the throne of France.
In these elections the French liberals, who were not in the army, did not
vote; while all conservatives, who wished above all things for a stable
and orderly government of law and for peace with other countries,
flocked to the polls.
</p><p>
Among the latter, of course, were the few Royalists who still remained
in France. Such, at least, was the view Marshall took of this
episode. To understand Marshall's subsequent career, too much weight
cannot be given this fact and, indeed, all the startling events in France
during the six historic months of Marshall's stay in Paris.
</p><p>
But Marshall did not take into account the vital fact that the
French soldiers had no chance to vote at this election. They were
scattered far and wide&mdash;in Italy, Germany, and elsewhere. Yet
these very men were the soul of the Revolutionary cause. And the
private soldiers were more enraged by the result of the French elections
than their generals&mdash;even than General Augereau, who was
tigerish in his wrath.
</p><p>
They felt that, while they were fighting on the battlefield, they had
been betrayed at the ballot box. To the soldiers of France the revolution
of the 18th Fructidor was the overthrow of their enemies
in their own country. The army felt that it had answered with loyal
bayonets a conspiracy of treasonable ballots. It now seems probable
that the soldiers and officers of the French armies were right in
this view.
</p><p>
Pinckney was absurdly accused of interfering in the elections in
behalf of the "Royalist Conspiracy." (Vans Murray to J. Q. Adams,
April 3, 1798; <i>Letters</i>: Ford, 391.) Such a thing, of course, was perfectly
impossible.</p></div>

<h3>FACING TALLEYRAND</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Society is divided into two classes; the shearers and the shorn. We should
always be with the former against the latter. (Talleyrand.)</p>

<p>To lend money to a belligerent power is to relinquish our neutrality. (Marshall.)</p></div>


<p>Diplomatically Marshall and his associates
found themselves marooned. Many and long were
their discussions of the situation. "We have had
several conversations on the extraordinary silence
of the Government concerning our reception,"
writes Marshall in his Journal. "The plunder of our
commerce sustains no abatements, the condemnations
of our vessels are press'd with ardor ... our
reception is postponed in a manner most unusual
&amp; contemptuous.</p>

<p>"I urge repeatedly that we ought, in a respectful
communication to the Minister [Talleyrand] ...
to pray for a suspension of all further proceedings
against American vessels until the further order of
the Directory....</p>

<p>"We have already permitted much time to pass
away, we could not be charged with precipitation,
&amp; I am willing to wait two or three days longer but
not more.... The existing state of things is to
France the most beneficial &amp; the most desirable, but
to America it is ruinous. I therefore urge that in a
few days we shall lay this interesting subject before
the Minister."<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall tells us that Gerry again opposed action,
holding that for the envoys to act would "irritate
the [French] Government." The Directory
"might take umbrage."<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Besides, declared Gerry,
France was in a quandary what to do and "any
movement on our part" would relieve her and put
the blame on the envoys. "But," records Marshall,
"in the address I propose I would say nothing which
could give umbrage, &amp; if, as is to be feared, France is
determined to be offended, she may quarrel with our
answer to any proposition she may make or even
with our silence." Pinckney agreed with Marshall;
but they yielded to Gerry in order to "preserve
unanimity."<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>Tidings soon arrived of the crushing defeat of the
Dutch fleet by the British; and on the heels of this
came reports that the Directory were ready to negotiate
with the Americans.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> Next morning, and four
days after the mysterious intimations to the Ameri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>can
envoys from Talleyrand through his confidential
secretary, a Parisian business man called on Pinckney
and told him that a Mr. Hottenguer,<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> "a native
of Switzerland who had been in America,"<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> and
"a gentleman of considerable credit and reputation,"
would call on Pinckney. Pinckney had met
Hottenguer on a former occasion, probably at The
Hague. That evening this cosmopolitan agent of
financiers and foreign offices paid the expected visit.
After a while Hottenguer "whispered ... that he
had a message from Talleyrand." Into the next room
went Pinckney and his caller. There Hottenguer
told Pinckney that the Directory were "exceedingly
irritated" at President Adams's speech and that
"they should be softened."</p>

<p>Indeed, the envoys would not be received, said
Hottenguer, unless the mellowing process were applied
to the wounded and angry Directory. He was
perfectly plain as to the method of soothing that
sore and sensitive body&mdash;"money" for the pockets
of its members and the Foreign Minister which
would be "at the disposal of M. Talleyrand."
Also a loan must be made to France. Becoming
still more explicit, Hottenguer stated the exact
amount of financial salve which must be applied
in the first step of the healing treatment required
from our envoys&mdash;a small bribe of one million
two hundred thousand livres [about fifty thousand
pounds sterling, or two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars].<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was absolutely required," reports Marshall,
"that we should ... pay the debts due by contract
from France to our citizens ... pay for the spoliations
committed on our commerce ... &amp; make a
considerable loan.... Besides this, added Mr. Hottenguer,
there must be something for the pocket ...
for the private use of the Directoire &amp; Minister
under the form of satisfying claims which," says
Marshall, "did not in fact exist."<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>Pinckney reported to his colleagues. Again the
envoys divided as to the course to pursue. "I was
decidedly of opinion," runs Marshall's chronicle,
"&amp; so expressed myself, that such a proposition
could not be made by a nation from whom any
treaty, short of the absolute surrender of the independence
of the United States was to be expected,
but that if there was a possibility of accommodation,
to give any countenance whatever to such a proposition
would be certainly to destroy that possibility
because it would induce France to demand from
us terms to which it was impossible for us to accede.
I therefore," continues Marshall, "thought
we ought, so soon as we could obtain the whole information,
to treat the terms as inadmissible and
without taking any notice of them to make some
remonstrance to the minister on our situation &amp; on
that of our countrymen." Pinckney agreed with
Marshall; Gerry dissented and declared that "the
whole negotiation ... would be entirely broken off
if such an answer was given as I [Marshall] had
hinted &amp; there would be a war between the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
nations." At last it was decided to get Hottenguer's
proposition in writing.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>When Pinckney so informed Hottenguer, the
latter announced that he had not dealt "immediately
with Talleyrand but through another gentleman
in whom Talleyrand had great confidence."
Hottenguer had no objection, however, to writing
out his "suggestions," which he did the next evening.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
The following morning he advised the envoys
that a Mr. Bellamy, "the confidential friend of
M. Talleyrand," would call and explain matters in
person. Decidedly, the fog was thickening. The envoys
debated among themselves as to what should
be done.</p>

<p>"I again urg'd the necessity of breaking off this
indirect mode of procedure," testifies Marshall; but
"Mr. Gerry reprobated precipitation, insisted on
further explanations as we could not completely
understand the scope &amp; object of the propositions
&amp; conceiv'd that we ought not abruptly object to
them." Marshall and Pinckney thought "that they
[Talleyrand's demands] were beyond our powers &amp; ... amounted to a surrender of the independence
of our country."<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> But Gerry had his way and the
weaving of the spider's web went on.</p>

<p>Two hours after candlelight that evening Hottenguer
and Bellamy entered Marshall's room where
the three Americans were waiting for them; and
Bellamy was introduced as "the confidential friend
of M. Talleyrand," of whom Hottenguer had told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
the envoys. Bellamy was, says Marshall, "a genevan
now residing in Hamburg but in Paris on a visit."<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
He went straight to the point. Talleyrand, he confided
to the envoys, was "a friend of America ...
the kindness and civilities he had personally received
in America" had touched his heart; and he
was burning to "repay these kindnesses." But what
could this anxious friend of America do when the
cruel Directory were so outraged at the American
President's address to Congress that they would
neither receive the envoys nor authorize "Talleyrand
to have any communications with" them.</p>

<p>Bellamy pointed out that under these circumstances
Talleyrand could not, of course, communicate
directly with the envoys; but "had authorized"
him to deal with them "and to promise" that
the French Foreign Minister would do his best to
get the Directory to receive the Americans if the
latter agreed to Talleyrand's terms. Nevertheless,
Bellamy "stated explicitly and repeatedly that he
was clothed with no authority"&mdash;he was not a
diplomat, he said, but only the trusted friend of Talleyrand.
He then pointed out the passages from
Adams's address<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> which had so exasperated the
French rulers and stated what the envoys must do
to make headway.</p>

<p>The American envoys, asserted Bellamy, must
make "a formal disavowal in writing ... that ...
the speech of the Citizen President," Barras, was
"not offensive" to America; must offer "reparation"
for President Adams's address; must affirm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
that the decree of the Directory,<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> which Adams had
denounced, was not "contrary to the treaty of
1778"; must state "in writing" the depredations on
American trade "by the English and French privateers,"
and must make "a formal declaration" that
Adams in his speech to Congress had not referred
to the French Government or its agents: if all this
were done "the French Republic is disposed to renew
their old-time relations with America" by a
new treaty which should place France "with respect
to the United States exactly on the same footing
as they [the United States] should be with England."
But, said Bellamy, there must be a secret
article of this new treaty providing for a loan from
America to France.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p>Impossible as these terms were, the whole business
must be preceded by a bribe. "I will not disguise
from you," said Bellamy, "that this situation being
met, the essential part of the treaty remains to be
adjusted.... <i>You must pay money&mdash;you must pay a
great deal of money.</i>" Little was said about the two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars bribe; "that,"
declare the envoys' dispatches to the American
Secretary of State, "being completely understood
on all sides to be required for the officers of the government,
and, therefore, needing no further explanation."
When all these conditions were complied
with, said Bellamy, "M. Talleyrand trusted that,
by his influence with the Directory, he could prevail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
on the government to receive" the Americans. For
two hours the talk ran on. Before Talleyrand's
agents left, the anxiously hospitable Gerry invited
them to breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>Into consultation once more went the envoys. "I
pressed strongly," writes Marshall in his Journal,
"the necessity of declaring that the propositions were
totally inadmissible" and that "it was derogatory
from the honor and wounded the real interests of
our country to permit ourselves, while unacknowledg'd,
to carry on this clandestine negotiation with
persons who produced no evidence of being authoriz'd
by the Directoire or the Minister to treat
with us. Mr. Gerry was quite of a contrary opinion
&amp; the old beaten ground about precipitation &amp;c. was
trodden once again. Gen'l Pinckney advocated decidedly
the same opinions with myself &amp; we determined
that the next morning should positively put
an end to these conferences."<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>"On our retiring," continues Marshall's narrative,
"Mr. Gerry began to propose further delays &amp; that
we shou'd inform them [Talleyrand's go-betweens]
that we wou'd take their propositions into consideration&mdash;I
improperly interrupted him &amp; declared
that I wou'd not consent to any proposition of the
sort, that the subject was already considered &amp; that
so far as my voice wou'd go I wou'd not permit it
to be supposed longer that we cou'd deliberate on
such propositions as were made to us."</p>

<p>Pinckney agreed with Marshall; but, for harmony's
sake, Marshall finally said that he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
return to America to "consult our government" on
this express condition only&mdash;"that France should
previously and immediately suspend all depredations
upon American commerce." For once, Gerry
assented and a letter was written accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>Hottenguer was prompt in his engagement to
breakfast with Gerry the next morning; but Bellamy
did not come till ten o'clock, explaining that he had
been closeted with Talleyrand. Bellamy was much
depressed; the Directory, he declared, would not receive
the envoys until the latter had disavowed President
Adams's speech, <i>unless</i> they "could find the
means to change their [the Directory's] determination
in this particular." What were such "means?"
asked the envoys. "I am not authorized to state
them," said Bellamy. "You must search for them
and propose them yourselves."</p>

<p>Still, Bellamy, merely as an individual, was willing
to suggest such "means." It was money, he explained.
The "Directory were jealous of their own
honor and the honor of the nation"; they demanded
the same treatment formerly accorded to the King;
and their "honor must be maintained in the manner
required" unless "the envoys substituted ...
something perhaps more valuable, and that was
money."<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p>It was all so simple, according to Bellamy. All
that the envoys had to do was to buy thirty-two
million florins of Dutch inscriptions at twenty shillings
to the pound. "It was certain," he assured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the Americans, "that after a time the Dutch
Government would repay ... the money, so that
America would ultimately lose nothing" and everybody
would be happy. But even if the envoys made
the loan in this way, the bribe of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars must be paid in addition.
Thereupon the envoys handed him the letter which
Marshall had prepared the night before, which
stated that they had no power to make a loan, but
could send one of their number to America for
consultation and instruction.</p>

<p>Bellamy was "disappointed" and at once modified
his language. Why did the envoys treat the
money proposition as coming from the Directory?
It was only his own personal suggestion. Then
"what has led to our present conversation?" asked
the envoys. Pinckney recalled Hottenguer's first
visit and the latter confirmed Pinckney's account.</p>

<p>Upon the envoys stating the differences between
France and America, to settle which was the purpose
of their mission, and gently resenting the demands
made upon them, Bellamy became excited. The
envoys' conduct was not to be borne, he exclaimed;
let them beware of the resentment of France. They
"could not help it," answered the envoys&mdash;the
Directory must look after France; the envoys must
look after the United States.</p>

<p>Bellamy was "in despair." What a provincial
view these Americans took of a diplomatic negotiation!
They must broaden their horizon. They must
acquire worldly wisdom. They must remember "the
respect which the Directory required"; they must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
realize that that august body "would exact as much
as was paid to the ancient kings." The envoys would
not be received without it; that was flat, Bellamy
informed them; and "he seemed to shudder at the
consequences."</p>

<p>Marshall and Pinckney simply would not see the
point. But Gerry was a man of the world who
could understand European diplomacy. Marshall
declared that the envoys were there to adjust international
differences. If, however, France "would
make war," then, said they: "We regret the unavoidable
necessity of defending ourselves."<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<p>For a little while Talleyrand's leeches dropped
away from the perplexed Americans. Marshall reported
to Washington French conditions as he had
observed them up to that time. He confirms to the
former President the American report that French
agriculture had been improved "in the course of the
present war":&mdash;</p>

<p>"In that part of the country through which I have
passed the evidences of plenty abound. The whole
earth appears to be in cultivation &amp; the harvests of
the present year appear to be as productive as the
fields which yield them are extensive.</p>

<p>"I am informed that every part of the country
exhibits the same aspect. If this be the fact, there
will probably remain, notwithstanding the demands
of the armies, a surplus of provisions."</p>

<p>Marshall briefly but clearly analyzes the economic
and commercial outcome of the war:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Manufactures have declined in the same ratio<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
that the cultivation of the soil has increas'd. War
has been made upon the great manufacturing towns
&amp; they are in a considerable degree destroy'd. With
manufactures France does not supply herself fully
from her internal resources.</p>

<p>"Those of Britain flow in upon her notwithstanding
the most severe prohibitory laws. The port of
Rotterdam is purposely left open by the English &amp;
their goods are imported by the Dutch under Prussian
and other neutral colors. They are smuggled in
great quantities into France.</p>

<p>"Peace, then, will find this [French] nation entirely
competent to the full supply of her colonies
with provisions and needing manufactures to be imported
for her own consumption.... France can
take from America tobacco &amp; raw cotton she can
supply us with wines, brandies &amp; silks."</p>

<p>Marshall then makes a searching commentary on
French politics.</p>

<p>"The existing political state of France is connected
with certain internal &amp; powerfully operating
causes by which it has been &amp; will continue to be
greatly influenc'd. Not the least of these is the tenure
by which property is held.</p>

<p>"In the course of the revolution it is believed that
more than half the land of France has become
national.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> Of this a very considerable proportion
has been sold at a low rate.</p>

<p>"It is true that much of it belonged to those who
have fallen under the Guillotine or who have been
termed emigrants. Among the emigrants are many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
whose attachment to their country has never been
shaken; &amp; what is remarkable, among them are
many who were never out of France. The law upon
this subject is worthy of attention.</p>

<p>"Any two persons, no matter what their reputation,
may, to some authority, I believe the municipality
of the district, write &amp; subscribe against any
person whatever a charge, that such person is an
emigrant, on receipt of which the person so charg'd
is without further investigation inscribed on the list
of emigrants.</p>

<p>"If the person so inscribed be afterwards apprehended
while his name remains on the list, the trial,
as I understand, is, not of the fact of emigration, but
of the identity of the persons, &amp; if this identity be
established, he is instantly fusiller'd [shot]. The law
is either rightly executed or permitted to be relax'd,
as the occasion or the temper of the times may
direct.</p>

<p>"During intervals of humanity some disposition
has been manifested to permit the return of those
who have never offended, who have been banished
by a terror which the government itself has reprobated,
&amp; to permit in case of arrestation, an investigation
of the fact of emigration as well as of the
identity of the person accus'd.</p>

<p>"There is too a great deal of property which has
been sold as national but which in truth was never
so, &amp; which may be reclaimed by the original proprietors.</p>

<p>"In this state the acquirers of national property
are of course extremely suspicious. They form a vast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
proportion of the population of France. They are
not only important in consequence of their numbers,
but in consequence of their vigor, their activity &amp;
that unity of interest which produces a unity of
effort among them.</p>

<p>"The armies too have been promised a milliard.
This promise rests upon the national property for its
performance. The effect of these circumstances cannot
escape your observation. Classes of citizens are
to be disfranchised against the next election."</p>

<p>Marshall and Pinckney, at this early stage of
Talleyrand's financial-diplomatic intrigue, were so
disgusted that they were on the point of "returning
to America immediately." The continuance of
French depredations on the high seas caused Marshall
to write to Washington as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The captures of our vessels seem to be only
limited by the ability to capture. That ability is
increasing, as the government has let out to hardy
adventurers the national frigates. Among those who
plunder us, who are most active in this infamous
business, &amp; most loud in vociferating criminations
equally absurd and untrue, are some unprincipled
apostates who were born in America.</p>

<p>"These sea rovers by a variety of means seem to
have acquired great influence in the government.</p>

<p>"This influence will be exerted to prevent an accommodation
between the United States &amp; France
and to prevent any regulations which may intercept
the passage of the spoils they have made on our commerce,
to their pockets. The government I believe
is too well disposed to promote their views. At pres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>ent
it seems to me to be radically hostile to our
country.</p>

<p>"I cou'd wish to form a contrary opinion, but to
do so I must shut my eyes on every object which
presents itself to them &amp; fabricate in my own mind
non-existing things, to be substituted for realities,
&amp; to form the basis of my creed.</p>

<p>"Might I be permitted to hazard an opinion it
wou'd be the Atlantic only can save us, &amp; that no
consideration will be sufficiently powerful to check
the extremities to which the temper of this government
will carry it, but an apprehension that we may
be thrown into the arms of Britain."</p>

<p>Although the Treaty of Campo Formio had been
signed on the 17th of October, Paris had not yet
heard of it. This treaty marked Bonaparte as
the most constructive diplomat, as well as the
foremost captain, of the age, for such he had
already proved himself to be. A week later, when
Marshall wrote the above letter to Washington
(October 24, 1797), he reported that "The negotiations
with the Emperor of Austria are said not
to have been absolutely broken off. Yesterday it
was said that peace with him was certain. Several
couriers have arrived lately from Buonaparte &amp; the
national debt rose yesterday from seven to ten
livres in the hundred. Whether this is founded on a
real expectation of peace with Austria or is the mere
work of stock jobbers is not for me to decide."</p>

<p>But three days afterward (October 27) the news
reached Paris; and Marshall adds this postscript:
"The definitive peace is made with the Emperor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
You will have seen the conditions. Venice has experienced
the fate of Poland. England is threatened
with an invasion."<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p>The thunders of cannon announcing Bonaparte's
success were still rolling through Paris when Talleyrand's
plotters again descended upon the American
envoys. Bellamy came and, Pinckney and Gerry
being at the opera, saw Marshall alone. The triumph
of Bonaparte was his theme. The victorious
general was now ready to invade England, announced
Bellamy; but "concerning America not a
syllable was said."<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>Already Talleyrand, sensitive as any hawk to
coming changes in the political weather, had begun
to insinuate himself into the confidence of the future
conqueror of Europe, whose diplomatic right arm
he so soon was to become. The next morning the
thrifty Hottenguer again visits the envoys. Bonaparte's
success in the negotiations of Campo Formio,
which sealed the victories of the French arms, has
alarmed Hottenguer, he declares, for the success of
the American mission.</p>

<p>Why, he asks, have the Americans made no proposition
to the Directory? That haughty body "were
becoming impatient and would take a decided
course in regard to America" if the envoys "could
not soften them," exclaims Talleyrand's solicitous
messenger. Surely the envoys can see that Bonaparte's
treaty with Austria has changed everything,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
and that therefore the envoys themselves must
change accordingly.</p>

<p>Exhibiting great emotion, Hottenguer asserts
that the Directory have determined "that all nations
should aid them [the French], or be considered
and treated as enemies." Think, he cries, of the
"power and violence of France." Think of the present
danger the envoys are in. Think of the wisdom of
"softening the Directory." But he hints that "the
Directory might be made more friendly." Gain
time! Gain time! Give the bribe, and gain time!
the wily agent advises the Americans. Otherwise,
France may declare war against America.</p>

<p>That would be most unfortunate, answer the envoys,
but assert that the present American "situation
was more ruinous than a declared war could
be"; for now American "commerce was floundering
unprotected." In case of war "America would protect
herself."</p>

<p>"You do not speak to the point," Hottenguer
passionately cries out; "it is money; it is expected
that you will offer money."</p>

<p>"We have given an answer to that demand," the
envoys reply.</p>

<p>"No," exclaims Hottenguer, "you have not!
What is your answer?"</p>

<p>"It is no," shouts Pinckney; "no; not a sixpence!"</p>

<p>The persistent Hottenguer does not desist. He
tells the envoys that they do not know the kind of
men they are dealing with. The Directory, he insists,
disregard the justice of American claims; care
nothing even for the French colonies; "consider<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
themselves as perfectly invulnerable" from the
United States. Money is the only thing that will
interest such terrible men. The Americans, parrying,
ask whether, even if they give money, Talleyrand
will furnish proofs that it will produce results. Hottenguer
evades the question. A long discussion ensues.</p>

<p>Pay the bribe, again and again urges the irritated
but tenacious go-between. Does not your Government
"know that nothing is to be obtained here
without money?"</p>

<p>"Our Government had not even suspected such a
state of things," declare the amazed Americans.</p>

<p>"Well," answers Hottenguer, "there is not an
American in Paris who could not have given that
information.... Hamburgh and other states of
Europe were obliged to buy peace ... nothing could
resist" the power of France; let the envoys think of
"the danger of a breach with her."<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<p>Thus far Pinckney mostly had spoken for the
envoys. Marshall now took up the American case.
Few utterances ever made by him more clearly reveal
the mettle of the man; and none better show his
conception of the American Nation's rights, dignity,
and station among the Governments of the world.</p>

<span class="caption">CHARLES COTESWORTH PINCKNEY</span>
</div>

<p>"I told him [Hottenguer]," writes Marshall, "that ... no nation estimated her [France's] power more
highly than America or wished more to be on amicable
terms with her, but that one object was still
dearer to us than the friendship of France which was
our national independence. That America had taken
a neutral station. She had a right to take it. No
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>nation had a right to force us out of it. That to lend ... money to a belligerent power abounding in every
thing requisite for war but money was to relinquish
our neutrality and take part in the war. To lend this
money under the lash &amp; coercion of France was to
relinquish the government of ourselves &amp; to submit
to a foreign government imposed on us by force,"
Marshall declared. "That we would make at least
one manly struggle before we thus surrendered our
national independence.</p>

<p>"Our case was different from that of the minor
nations of Europe," he explained. "They were unable
to maintain their independence &amp; did not expect
to do so. America was a great, &amp; so far as concerned
her self-defense, a powerful nation. She was able to
maintain her independence &amp; must deserve to lose it
if she permitted it to be wrested from her. France &amp;
Britain have been at war for near fifty years of the
last hundred &amp; might probably be at war for fifty
years of the century to come."</p>

<p>Marshall asserted that "America has no motives
which could induce her to involve herself in those
wars and that if she now preserved her neutrality &amp;
her independence it was most probable that she
would not in future be afraid as she had been for four
years past&mdash;but if she now surrendered her rights of
self government to France or permitted them to be
taken from her she could not expect to recover them
or to remain neutral in any future war."<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>For two hours Talleyrand's emissary pleads,
threatens, bullies, argues, expostulates. Finally, he
departs to consult with his fellow conspirator, or to
see Talleyrand, the master of both. Thus ran the
opening dialogue between the French bribe procurers
and the American envoys. Day after day, week after
week, the plot ran on like a play upon the stage. "A
Mr. Hauteval whose fortune lay in the island of St.
Domingo" called on Gerry and revealed how pained
Talleyrand was that the envoys had not visited him.
Again came Hauteval, whom Marshall judged to be
the only one of the agents "solicitous of preserving
peace."</p>

<p>Thus far the envoys had met with the same request,
that they "call upon Talleyrand at private
hours." Marshall and Pinckney said that, "having
been treated in a manner extremely disrespectful" to
their country, they could not visit the Minister of
Foreign Affairs "in the existing state of things ...
unless he should expressly signify his wish" to see
them "&amp; would appoint a time &amp; place." But, says
Marshall, "Mr. Gerry having known Mr. Talleyrand
in Boston considered it a piece of personal respect
to wait on him &amp; said that he would do so."<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></p>

<p>Hottenguer again calls to explain how anxious
Talleyrand was to serve the envoys. Make "one
more effort," he urges, "to enable him to do so."
Bonaparte's daring plan for the invasion of England
was under way and Hottenguer makes the most of
this. "The power and haughtiness of France," the
inevitable destruction of England, the terrible con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>sequences
to America, are revealed to the Americans.
"Pay by way of fees" the two hundred and
fifty thousand dollar bribe, and the Directory would
allow the envoys to stay in Paris; Talleyrand would
then even consent to receive them while one of them
went to America for instructions.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></p>

<p>Why hesitate? It was the usual thing; the Portuguese
Minister had been dealt with in similar fashion,
argues Hottenguer. The envoys counter by asking
whether American vessels will meanwhile be
restored to their owners. They will not, was the
answer. Will the Directory stop further outrages on
American commerce, ask the envoys? Of course
not, exclaims Hottenguer. We do "not so much
regard a little money as [you] said," declare the
envoys, "although we should hazard ourselves by
giving it but we see only evidences of the most
extreme hostility to us." Thereupon they go into a
long and useless explanation of the American case.</p>

<p>Gerry's visit to his "old friend" Talleyrand was
fruitless; the Foreign Minister would not receive
him.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Gerry persisted, nevertheless, and finally
found the French diplomat at home. Talleyrand
demanded the loan, and held a new decree of the
Directory before Gerry, but proposed to withhold it
for a week so that the Americans could think it over.
Gerry hastened to his colleagues with the news.
Marshall and Pinckney told Hauteval to inform Talleyrand
"that unless there is a hope that the Directory
itself might be prevailed upon by reason to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
alter its arr&ecirc;t&eacute;, we do not wish to suspend it for an
instant."<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

<p>The next evening, when Marshall and Pinckney
were away from their quarters, Bellamy and Hottenguer
called on Gerry, who again invited them
to breakfast. This time Bellamy disclosed the fact
that Talleyrand was now intimately connected with
Bonaparte and the army in Italy. Let Gerry ponder
over that! "The fate of Venice was one which might
befall the United States," exclaimed Talleyrand's
mouthpiece; and let Gerry not permit Marshall and
Pinckney to deceive themselves by expecting help
from England&mdash;France could and would attend
to England, invade her, break her, force her to
peace. Where then would America be? Thus for an
hour Bellamy and Hottenguer worked on Gerry.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<p>Far as Talleyrand's agents had gone in trying to
force the envoys to offer a bribe of a quarter of a million
dollars, to the Foreign Minister and Directory,
they now went still further. The door of the chamber
of horrors was now opened wide to the stubborn
Americans. Personal violence was intimated; war
was threatened. But Marshall and Pinckney refused
to be frightened.</p>

<p>The Directory, Talleyrand, and their emissaries,
however, had not employed their strongest resource.
"Perhaps you believe," said Bellamy to the envoys,
"that in returning and exposing to your countrymen
the unreasonableness of the demands of this government,
you will unite them in their resistance to those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
demands. You are mistaken; you ought to know
that the diplomatic skill of France and the means she
possesses in your country are sufficient to enable
her, with the French party in America,<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> to throw
the blame which will attend the rupture of the
negotiations on the federalists, as you term yourselves,
but on the British party as France terms
you. And you may assure yourselves that this will
be done."<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was out at last. This was the hidden card
that Talleyrand had been keeping back. And it was
a trump. Talleyrand managed to have it played
again by a fairer hand before the game was over.
Yes, surely; here was something to give the obstinate
Marshall pause. For the envoys knew it to be true.
There was a French party in America, and there
could be little doubt that it was constantly growing
stronger.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> Gen&ecirc;t's reception had made that plain.
The outbursts throughout America of enthusiasm
for France had shown it. The popular passion exhibited,
when the Jay Treaty was made public, had
proved it. Adams's narrow escape from defeat had
demonstrated the strength of French sympathy in
America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>A far more dangerous circumstance, as well known
to Talleyrand as it was to the envoys, made the
matter still more serious&mdash;the democratic societies,
which, as we have seen, had been organized in great
numbers throughout the United States had pushed
the French propaganda with zeal, system, and ability;
and were, to America, what the Jacobin Clubs
had been to France before their bloody excesses.
They had already incited armed resistance to the
Government of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Thorough information
of the state of things in the young country
across the ocean had emboldened Barras, upon taking
leave of Monroe, to make a direct appeal to the
American people in disregard of their own Government,
and, indeed, almost openly against it. The
threat, by Talleyrand's agents, of the force which
France could exert in America, was thoroughly
understood by the envoys. For, as we have seen,
there was a French party in America&mdash;"a party,"
as Washington declared, "determined to advocate
French measures under <i>all</i> circumstances."<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> It was
common knowledge among all the representatives
of the American Government in Europe that the
French Directory depended upon the Republican
Party in this country. "They reckon ... upon
many friends and partisans among us," wrote the
American Minister in London to the American
Minister at The Hague.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p>The Directory even had its particular agents in
the United States to inflame the American people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
against their own Government if it did not yield to
French demands. Weeks before the President, in
1797, had called Congress in special session on
French affairs, "the active and incessant man&#339;uvres
of French agents in" America made William
Smith think that any favorable action of France
"will drive the great mass of knaves &amp; fools back
into her [France's] arms," notwithstanding her
piracies upon our ships.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<p>On November 1 the envoys again decided to "hold
no more indirect intercourse with" Talleyrand or the
Directory. Marshall and Pinckney told Hottenguer
that they thought it "degrading our country to
carry on further such an indirect intercourse"; and
that they "would receive no propositions" except
from persons having "acknowledged authority."
After much parrying, Hottenguer again unparked
the batteries of the French party in America.</p>

<p>He told Marshall and Pinckney that "intelligence
had been received from the United States, that if
Colonel Burr and Mr. Madison had constituted the
Mission, the difference between the two nations
would have been accommodated before this time."
Talleyrand was even preparing to send a memorial
to America, threatened Hottenguer, complaining
that the envoys were "unfriendly to an accommodation
with France."</p>

<p>The insulted envoys hotly answered that Talleyrand's
"correspondents in America took a good deal
on themselves when they undertook to say how the
Directory would have received Colonel Burr and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Mr. Madison"; and they defied Talleyrand to send
a memorial to the United States.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p>Disgusted with these indirect and furtive methods,
Marshall insisted on writing Talleyrand on the subject
that the envoys had been sent to France to
settle. "I had been for some time extremely solicitous"
that such a letter should be sent, says Marshall.
"It appears to me that for three envoys extraordinary
to be kept in Paris thirty days without
being received can only be designed to degrade &amp;
humiliate their country &amp; to postpone a consideration
of its just &amp; reasonable complaints till future
events in which it ought not to be implicated shall
have determined France in her conduct towards it.
Mr. Gerry had been of a contrary opinion &amp; we had
yielded to him but this evening he consented that
the letter should be prepared."<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless Gerry again objected.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> At last the
Paris newspapers took a hand. "It was now in the
power of the Administration [Directory]," says
Marshall, "to circulate by means of an enslaved
press precisely those opinions which are agreeable
to itself &amp; no printer dares to publish an examination
of them."</p>

<p>"With this tremendous engine at its will, it [the
Directory] almost absolutely controls public opinion
on every subject which does not immediately affect
the interior of the nation. With respect to its designs
against America it experiences not so much
difficulty as ... would have been experienced had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
our own countrymen labored to persuade them that
our Government was under a British influence."<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></p>

<p>On November 3, Marshall writes Charles Lee:
"When I clos'd my last letter I did not expect to
address you again from this place. I calculated on
being by this time on my return to the United States....
My own opinion is that France wishes to retain
America in her present situation until her negotiation
with Britain, which it is believed is about to
recommence, shall have been terminated, and a
present absolute rupture with America might encourage
England to continue the war and peace with
England ... will put us more in her [France's]
power.... Our situation is more intricate and difficult
than you can believe.... The demand for
money has been again repeated. The last address
to us ... concluded ... that the French party in
America would throw all the blame of a rupture on
the federalists.... We were warned of the fate of
Venice. All these conversations are preparing for a
public letter but the delay and the necessity of writing
only in cypher prevents our sending it by this
occasion.... I wish you could ... address the
Minister concerning our reception. We despair of
doing anything.... Mr. Putnam an American citizen
has been arrested and sent to jail under the pretext
of his cheating frenchmen.... This ... is a
mere pretext. It is considered as ominous toward
Americans generally. He like most of them is a
creditor of the [French] government."<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally the envoys sent Talleyrand the formal
request, written by Marshall,<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> that the Directory
receive them. Talleyrand ignored it. Ten more days
went by. When might they expect an answer? inquired
the envoys. Talleyrand parried and delayed.
"We are not yet received," wrote the envoys to
Secretary of State Pickering, "and the condemnation
of our vessels ... is unremittingly continued.
Frequent and urgent attempts have been made
to inveigle us again into negotiations with persons
not officially authorized, of which the obtaining of
money is the basis; but we have persisted in declining
to have any further communication relative
to diplomatic business with persons of that description."<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<p>Anxious as Marshall was about the business of his
mission, which now rapidly was becoming an intellectual
duel between Talleyrand and himself, he was
far more concerned as to the health of his wife, from
whom he had heard nothing since leaving America.
Marshall writes her a letter full of apprehension, but
lightens it with a vague account of the amusements,
distractions, and dissipations of the French Capital.</p>

<p>"I have not, since my departure from the United
States," Marshall tells his wife, "received a single
letter from you or from any one of my friends in
America. Judge what anxiety I must feel concerning
you. I do not permit myself for a moment to suspect
that you are in any degree to blame for this. I am
sure you have written often to me but unhappily for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
me your letters have not found me. I fear they will
not. They have been thrown over board or intercepted.
Such is the fate of the greater number of the
letters addressed by Americans to their friends in
France, such I fear will be the fate of all that may
be address'd to me.</p>

<p>"In my last letter I informed you that I counted
on being at home in March. I then expected to
have been able to leave this country by christmas
at furthest &amp; such is my impatience to see you &amp;
my dear children that I had determined to risk a
winter passage." He asks his wife to request Mr.
Wickham to see that one of Marshall's law cases
"may ly till my return. I think nothing will prevent
my being at the chancery term in May.</p>

<p>"Oh God," cries Marshall, "how much time &amp;
how much happiness have I thrown away! Paris
presents one incessant round of amusement &amp; dissipation
but very little I believe even for its inhabitants
of that society which interests the heart. Every
day you may see something new magnificent &amp; beautiful,
every night you may see a spectacle which
astonishes &amp; enchants the imagination. The most
lively fancy aided by the strongest description cannot
equal the reality of the opera. All that you can
conceive &amp; a great deal more than you can conceive
in the line of amusement is to be found in this gay
metropolis but I suspect it would not be easy to find
a friend.</p>

<p>"I would not live in Paris," Marshall tells his
"dearest Polly" "[if I could] ... be among the
wealthiest of its citizens. I have changed my lodg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>ing
much for the better. I liv'd till within a few
days in a house where I kept my own apartments
perfectly in the style of a miserable old bachelor
without any mixture of female society. I now have
rooms in the house of a very accomplished a very
sensible &amp; I believe a very amiable Lady whose temper,
very contrary to the general character of her
country women, is domestic &amp; who generally sits
with us two or three hours in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"This renders my situation less unpleasant than
it has been but nothing can make it eligible. Let me
see you once more &amp; I ... can venture to assert that
no consideration would induce me ever again to consent
to place the Atlantic between us. Adieu my
dearest Polly. Preserve your health &amp; be happy as
possible till the return of him who is ever yours."<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p>The American Minister in London was following
anxiously the fortunes of our envoys in Paris, and
gave them frequent information and sound advice.
Upon learning of their experiences, King writes
that "I will not allow myself yet to despair of
your success, though my apprehensions are greater
than my hopes." King enclosed his Dispatch number
52 to the American Secretary of State, which
tells of the Portuguese Treaty and the decline of
Spain's power in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>

<p>In reply, Pinckney writes King, on December 14,
that the Directory "are undoubtedly hostile to our
Government, and are determined, if possible, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
effectuate a change in our administration, and to
oblige our present President [Adams] to resign," and
further adds that the French authorities contemplate
expelling from France "every American who
could not prove" that he was for France and against
America.</p>

<p>"Attempts," he continues, "are made to divide
the Envoys and with that view some civilities are
shown to Mr. G.[erry] and none to the two others
[Marshall and Pinckney].... The American Jacobins
here pay him [Gerry] great Court."<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> The little
New Englander already was yielding to the seductions
of Talleyrand, and was also responsive to
the flattery of a group of unpatriotic Americans in
Paris who were buttering their own bread by playing
into the hands of the Directory and the French
Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Marshall now beheld a stage of what he believed
was the natural development of unregulated democracy.
Dramatic events convinced him that he was
witnessing the growth of license into absolutism.
Early in December Bonaparte arrived in Paris.
Swiftly the Conqueror had come from Rastadt, traveling
through France <i>incognito</i>, after one of his lightning-flash
speeches to his soldiers reminding them of
"the Kings whom you have vanquished, the people
upon whom you have conferred liberty." The young
general's name was on every tongue.</p>

<p>Paris was on fire to see and worship the hero. But
Bonaparte kept aloof from the populace. He made
himself the child of mystery. The future Emperor of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the French, clad in the garments of a plain citizen,
slipped unnoticed through the crowds. He would
meet nobody but scholars and savants of world
renown. These he courted; but he took care that this
fact was known to the people. In this course he continued
until the stage was set and the cue for his
entrance given.</p>

<p>Finally the people's yearning to behold and pay
homage to their soldier-statesman becomes a passion
not to be denied. The envious but servile Directory
yield, and on December 10, 1797, a splendid
festival in Bonaparte's honor is held at the Luxembourg.
The scene flames with color: captured battle-flags
as decorations; the members of the Directory
appareled as Roman Consuls; foreign ministers in
their diplomatic costumes; officers in their uniforms;
women brilliantly attired in the height of
fashion.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> At last the victorious general appears on
the arm of Talleyrand, the latter gorgeously clad in
the dress of his high office; but Bonaparte, short,
slender, and delicate, wearing the plainest clothes
of the simplest citizen.</p>

<p>Upon this superb play-acting John Marshall
looked with placid wonder. Here, then, thought
this Virginian, who had himself fought for liberty
on many a battlefield, were the first fruits of French
revolutionary republicanism. Marshall beheld no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
devotion here to equal laws which should shield all
men, but only adoration of the sword-wielder who
was strong enough to rule all men. In the fragile,
eagle-faced little warrior,<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> Marshall already saw the
man on horseback advancing out of the future; and
in the thunders of applause he already heard the
sound of marching armies, the roar of shotted guns,
the huzzas of charging squadrons.</p>

<p>All this was something that Jefferson had not seen.
Jefferson's sojourn in France had been at the time
when the French Revolution was just sprouting; and
he foresaw only that beautiful idealism into which
the glorious dreamers of the time fondly imagined
the Revolution would flower.</p>

<p>But Marshall was in Paris after the guillotine had
done its work; when corruption sat in the highest
places of government; and when military glory in the
name of liberty had become the deity of the people.
So where Jefferson expected that the roses of peace
would bloom, Marshall saw clusters of bayonets, as
the fruitage of the French Revolution.</p>

"Good God&mdash;he has mistaken the lamps of Paris for an illumination
on his arrival," writes our alarmed Minister at The Hague,
"and the salutations of fisherwomen for a procession of chaste matrons
hailing the great Pacificator!... His foible is to mistake things of
common worldly politeness for deference to his rank of which he
rarely loses the idea.... Gerry is no more fit to enter the labyrinth of
Paris as a town&mdash;alone&mdash;than an innocent is, much less formed to
play a game with the political genius of that city ... without some
very steady friend at his elbow.... Of all men in America he is ...
the least qualify'd to play a part in Paris, either among the men or the
women&mdash;he is too virtuous for the last&mdash;too little acquainted with
the world and himself for the first." (Vans Murray to J. Q. Adams,

<h3>THE AMERICAN MEMORIAL</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Separated far from Europe, we mean not to mingle in her quarrels. (Marshall.)</p>

<p>A fraudulent neutrality is no neutrality at all. (Marshall.)</p>

<p>We have a very considerable party in America who are strongly in our interest.
(Madame de Villette.)</p></div>


<p>Four days after the festival of triumph to Bonaparte,
Talleyrand's agents resumed their work. The
sordid scenes were repeated, but their monotony was
broken. Now the lady of the plot appeared upon the
scene. In the long, vexed, and fruitless days of their
stay in Paris, the American envoys, it seems, were
not without the solace and diversion of the society
of the French Capital.</p>

<p>Among the attractive feminine acquaintances they
made, one was undoubtedly an agent of the French
Foreign Office. Madame de Villette was one of the
most engaging women in the French Capital.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> Cultivated,
brilliant, and altogether charming, she made
herself particularly agreeable to the American envoys.
She and Marshall became especially good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
friends; but Madame de Villette ventured no diplomatic
suggestions to him, notwithstanding his easy
good nature. She was far too good a judge of character
to commit that indiscretion. So was Talleyrand,
who by this time had begun to appreciate
Marshall's qualities. But Pinckney, hearty, handsome
man of the world, but without Marshall's
penetration and adroitness, was another matter.
Gerry the intriguers could already count upon; and
only one other member of the commission was necessary
to their ends. Perhaps Pinckney might be won
over by this captivating Frenchwoman. On some
occasion Madame de Villette approached him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why will you not lend us money?" said she to
Pinckney. "If you were to make us a loan, all matters
will be adjusted. When you were contending for
your Revolution we lent you money." Pinckney
pointed out the differences&mdash;that America had
<i>requested</i> a loan of France, and France now <i>demanded</i>
a loan of America. "Oh, no," said she. "We do not
make a demand; we think it more delicate that the
offer should come from you; but M. Talleyrand has
mentioned to me (who am surely not in his confidence)
the necessity of your making us a loan, and I
know that he has mentioned it to two or three others;
and that you have been informed of it; and I will assure
you that, if you remain here six months longer,
you will not advance a single step further in your
negotiations without a loan."</p>

<p>If that is so, bluntly answered Pinckney, the envoys
might as well leave at once. "Why," exclaimed
Talleyrand's fair agent, "that might possibly lead to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
a rupture, which you had better avoid; for we have a
very considerable party in America who are strongly
in our interest."<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></p>

<p>The fox-like Talleyrand had scented another hole
by which he might get at his elusive quarry. "Every
man has his price" was his doctrine; and his experience
hitherto had proved it sound. He found that
the brilliant Paris adventurer, Beaumarchais, had a
lawsuit against the State of Virginia. Beaumarchais
had won this suit in the lower court and it was now
pending on appeal. John Marshall was his attorney.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>
Here, then, thought Talleyrand, was the way to
reach this unknown quantity in his problem.</p>

<p>On December 17, Marshall, happening into Gerry's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
apartment, found Bellamy there. Beaumarchais had
given a dinner to Marshall and his fellow envoys,
from which Bellamy had been kept by a toothache.
The envoys had returned Beaumarchais's courtesy;
and he had retired from this dinner "much indisposed."<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
Since then Marshall had not seen his
client. Bellamy casually remarked that he had not
known, until within a short time, that Marshall was
the attorney for Beaumarchais, who, he said, had
very high regard for his Virginia attorney.</p>

<p>Marshall, his lawyer's instincts at once aroused,
told Bellamy that Beaumarchais's case was of very
great magnitude and that he was deeply interested
in it. Whereupon, in a low tone, spoken aside for
his ear only, Bellamy told Marshall that, in case
the latter won the suit, Beaumarchais would "sacrifice
&pound;50,000 Sterling of it as the private gratification"
demanded by the Directory and Talleyrand,
"so that the gratification might be made
without any actual loss to the American government."
Marshall rejected this offer and informed
Pinckney of it.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's character is revealed by the entry he
promptly made in his Journal. "Having been originally
the Counsel of Mr. de Beaumarchais, I had
determined &amp; so I informed Genl. Pinckney, that I
would not by my voice establish any argument in his
favor, but that I would positively oppose any admission
of the claim of any French citizen if not accompanied
with the admission of claims of the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
citizens to property captured and condemned for
want of a R&ocirc;le d'&eacute;quipage."<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>Bellamy then urged upon Gerry his plan of the
Marshall-Beaumarchais arrangement. Talleyrand
had been entertaining Gerry privately, and the flattered
New Englander again wished to call on the
French Minister, "to return the civility" by inviting
Talleyrand to dinner.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> To Talleyrand, then, went
Gerry in company with Bellamy and asked the
Foreign Minister to dine with him. Then Gerry
tediously reviewed the situation, concluding in a
manner that must have amused the bored Talleyrand:
He would rather see the envoys depart for
some city in another nation, said Gerry, until the
Directory would receive them, than to stay in Paris
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Gerry was sure that the French diplomat was
alarmed by this stern threat. "M. Talleyrand appeared
to be uneasy at this declaration," he told
his colleagues. Still, Talleyrand avoided "saying
a word on it"; but he did say that Bellamy's representations
"might always be relied on." Talleyrand
declared that he would go further; he would himself
write out his propositions. This he proceeded to
do, held the writing before Gerry's eyes and then
burned it; after this performance Talleyrand said
he would dine with Gerry "the decade [ten days]
after the present."<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, Gerry dined with the Foreign
Minister. It was not a merry function. Aside
from his guest of honor, the French Minister also
had at his board Hottenguer, Bellamy, and Hauteval.
Gerry could not speak French and Hauteval acted
as translator. It must have been a pallid feast; the
brilliant, witty, accomplished Talleyrand, man of
the world, <i>bon vivant</i>, and lover of gayety; the solemn,
dull, and rigid Gerry; the three trained French
agents, one of them, as interpreter, the only means
of general communication.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> On rising from the
table, Hottenguer at once brought up the question
of the bribe. Would the envoys now give it? Had
they the money ready? Gerry answered no!<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p>Talleyrand, by now the mouthpiece of the rising
Bonaparte, had proposed terms of peace to Great
Britain; "the price was a Bribe of a Million Sterling
to be divided among Directors, Ministers, and
others. Talleyrand's Department was to share one
hundred thousand Pounds Sterling." The British
Government declined.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>King in London hastens to inform his American
diplomatic associates in Paris of this offer, and cautions
the envoys to act in concert. To Pinckney,
King writes in cipher his anxiety about Gerry, whose
integrity King had hoped would "overcome a miserable
vanity and a few little defects of character ...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
which I now fear have been discovered by those who
will be assiduous to turn them to mischief."</p>

<p>From the same source Pinckney is warned: "You
must not appear to suspect what you may really
know; ... you must ... save him [Gerry] and, in
doing so, prevent the Division that would grow out
of a Schism in your Commission." Gerry will be all
right, thinks King, "unless Pride shall be put in
opposition to Duty, or Jealousy shall mislead a mind
neither ingenuous nor well organized, but habitually
suspicious, and, when assailed by personal vanity,
inflexible."<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>Pinckney informs King of the situation in Paris
on December 27, declaring "that we ought to request
our Passports and no longer exhibit to the
World the unprecedented Spectacle of three Envoys
Extraordinary from a free and independent nation,
in vain soliciting to be heard."<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>Marshall now insists that the American case be
formally stated to the French Government. Gerry
at last agrees.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> Marshall, of course, prepares this
vastly important state paper. For two weeks he
works over the first half of this historic document.
"At my request Genl. Pinckney &amp; Mr. Gerry met in
my room &amp; I read to them the first part of a letter
to the Minister of Exterior Relations which consisted
of a justification of the American Government,"<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>
he relates in his Journal.</p>

<p>Over the last half of the American case, Marshall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
spends seven days. "The Second part of the letter
to the Minister of Exterior Relations, comprehending
the claims of the United States upon France,
being also prepared, I read it to Genl Pinckney &amp;
Mr. Gerry." Both sections of Marshall's letter to
Talleyrand were submitted to his colleagues for
suggestions.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>It was hard work to get Gerry to examine and sign
the memorial. "I had so repeatedly pressed Mr.
Gerry," notes Marshall, "on the subject of our letter
prepared for the Minister of Exterior Relations &amp;
manifested such solicitude for its being so completed
as to enable us to send it, that I had obviously offended.
Today I have urged that subject and for the
last time."<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> Two days later Marshall chronicles
that "Mr. Gerry finished the examination of our
letter to the Minister of Exterior Relations."<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> A
week later the letter, translated and signed, is delivered
to Talleyrand.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>Upon this memorial were based future and successful
American negotiations,<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> and the statement
by Marshall remains to this day one of the ablest
state papers ever produced by American diplomacy.</p>

<p>Marshall reminds Talleyrand of the frequent and
open expressions of America's regard for France,
given "with all the ardor and sincerity of youth."
These, he says, were considered in America "as evidencing
a mutual friendship, to be as durable as the
republics themselves." Unhappily the scene changed,
says Marshall, and "America looks around in vain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
for the ally or the friend." He pictures the contrast
in the language and conduct of the French
Government with what had passed before, and says
that the French charge of American partiality toward
Great Britain is unfounded.</p>

<p>Marshall then reviews the international situation
and makes it so plain that America could not take
part in the European wars, that even Talleyrand
was never able to answer the argument. "When
that war [began] which has been waged with such
unparalleled fury," he writes, "which in its vast
vicissitudes of fortune has alternately threatened
the very existence of the conflicting parties, but
which, in its progress, has surrounded France with
splendor, and added still more to her glory than
to her territory," America found herself at peace
with all the belligerent Powers; she was connected
with some of them by treaties of amity and commerce,
and with France by a treaty of alliance.</p>

<p>But these treaties, Marshall points out, did not
require America to take part in this war. "Being
bound by no duty to enter into the war, the Government
of the United States conceived itself bound by
duties, the most sacred, to abstain from it." Upon
the ground that man, even in different degrees of
social development, is still the natural friend of
man, "the state of peace, though unstipulated by
treaty," was the only course America could take.
"The laws of nature" enjoined this, Marshall announces;
and in some cases "solemn and existing engagements ... require a religious observance" of it.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the moral ground upon which Marshall
built his argument, and he strengthened it by practical
considerations. "The great nations of Europe,"
he writes, "either impelled by ambition or by existing
or supposed political interests, peculiar to themselves,
have consumed more than a third of the
present century in wars." The causes that produced
this state of things "cannot be supposed to have been
entirely extinguished, and humanity can scarcely
indulge the hope that the temper or condition of
man is so altered as to exempt the next century from
the ills of the past. Strong fortifications, powerful
navies, immense armies, the accumulated wealth of
ages, and a full population, enable the nations of
Europe to support those wars."<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p>Problems of this character, Marshall explains,
must be solved by European countries, not by the
United States. For, "encircled by no dangerous
Powers, they [the Americans] neither fear, nor are
jealous of their neighbors," says Marshall, "and are
not, on that account, obliged to arm for their own
safety." He declares that America, separated from
Europe "by a vast and friendly ocean," has "no
motive for a voluntary war," but "the most powerful
reasons to avoid it."<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p>America's great and undefended commerce, made
necessary by her then economic conditions, would
be, Marshall contends, the "immediate and certain
victim" of engaging in European wars; and he then
demonstrates the disastrous results to America of
departing from her policy of Neutrality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>The immense and varied resources of the United
States can only be used for self-defense, reasons the
Virginia lawyer. "Neither the genius of the nation,
nor the state of its own finances admit of calling its
citizens from the plough but to defend their own
liberty and their own firesides."</p>

<p>He then points out that, in addition to the moral
wrong and material disaster of America's taking part
in France's wars, such a course means the launching
into the almost boundless ocean of European politics.
It implies "contracting habits of national conduct
and forming close political connections which
must have compromitted the future peace of the nation,
and have involved it in all the future quarrels
of Europe."</p>

<p>Marshall then describes the "long train of armies,
debts, and taxes, checking the growth, diminishing
happiness, and perhaps endangering the liberty of
the United States, which must have followed." And
all this for what? Not to fulfill America's treaties;
"not to promote her own views, her own objects, her
own happiness, her own safety; but to move as a
satellite around some other greater planet, whose
laws she must of necessity obey."<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p>"It was believed," he declares, "that France
would derive more benefit from the Neutrality of
America than from her becoming a party in the
war." Neutrality determined upon, he insists that
"increased motives of honor and of duty commanded
its faithful observance.... A fraudulent neutrality
is no neutrality at all.... A ... nation which would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
be admitted to its privileges, should also perform the
duties it enjoins."</p>

<p>If the American Government, occupying a neutral
position, had granted "favors unstipulated by treaty,
to one of the belligerent Powers which it refused to
another, it could no longer have claimed the immunities
of a situation of which the obligations were forgotten;
it would have become a party to the war as
certainly as if war had been openly and formally declared,
and it would have added to the madness of
wantonly engaging in such a hazardous conflict, the
dishonor of insincere and fraudulent conduct; it
would have attained, circuitously, an object which it
could not plainly avow or directly pursue, and would
have tricked the people of the United States into a
war which it would not venture openly to declare."</p>

<p>Then follows this keen thrust which Talleyrand
could not evade: "It was a matter of real delight to
the government and people of America," suavely
writes Marshall, "to be informed that France did
not wish to interrupt the peace they [the American
people] enjoyed."</p>

<p>Marshall then makes a sudden and sharp attack
memorable in the records of diplomatic dueling. He
calls attention to the astounding conduct of the
French Minister on American soil immediately after
the American Government had proclaimed its Neutrality
to the world and had notified American citizens
of the duties which that Neutrality enjoined. In
polite phrase he reminds Talleyrand of Gen&ecirc;t's assumption
of "the functions of the government to
which he was deputed, ... although he was not even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
acknowledged as a minister or had reached the
authority which should inspect his credentials."</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this, says Marshall, "the
American Government resolved to see in him [Gen&ecirc;t]
only the representative of a republic to which it was
sincerely attached" and "gave him the same warm
and cordial reception which he had experienced from
its citizens without a single exception from Charleston
to Philadelphia."</p>

<p>Two paragraphs follow of fulsome praise of France,
which would seem to have been written by Gerry,
who insisted on revising the memorial.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> But in swift
contrast Marshall again throws on the screen the
indefensible performances of the French Minister in
America and the tolerance with which the American
Government treated them. "In what manner would
France have treated any foreign minister, who
should have dared to so conduct himself toward this
republic?... In what manner would the American
Government have treated him [Gen&ecirc;t] had he been
the representative of any other nation than France?"</p>

<p>No informed man can doubt the answer to these
questions, says Marshall. "From the Minister of
France alone could this extraordinary conduct be
borne with temper." But "to have continued to bear
it without perceiving its extreme impropriety would
have been to have merited the contempt" of the
world and of France herself. "The Government of
the United States did feel it," declares Marshall, but
did not attribute Gen&ecirc;t's misconduct to the French
Nation. On the contrary, the American Government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
"distinguished strongly between the [French] Government
and its Minister," and complained "in the
language of a friend afflicted but not irritated."
Gen&ecirc;t's recall "was received with universal joy" in
America, "as a confirmation that his ... conduct
was attributable only to himself"; and "not even the
publication of his private instructions could persuade
the American Government to ascribe any part
of it to this [French] republic."<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>Marshall further points out "the exertions of the
United States to pay up the arrearages" of their debt
to France; America's "disinterested and liberal advances
to the sufferers of St. Domingo ... whose
recommendation was that they were Frenchmen and
unfortunate"; and other acts of good-will of the
American Government toward the French Republic.</p>

<p>He then makes a characteristically clear and convincing
argument upon the points at issue between
France and America. France complained that one
article of the Jay Treaty provided that in case of war
the property of an enemy might be taken by either
out of the ships of the other; whereas, by the Treaty
of 1778 between France and America, neither party
should take out of the vessels of the other the goods
of its enemy. France contended that this was a discrimination
against her in favor of Great Britain.
Marshall shows that this provision in the Jay Treaty
was merely the statement of the existing law of
nations, and that therefore the Jay Treaty gave no
new rights to Great Britain.</p>

<p>Marshall reminds Talleyrand that any two na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>tions
by treaty have the power to alter, as to their
mutual intercourse, the usages prescribed by international
law; that, accordingly, France and America
had so changed, as between themselves, the law of
nations respecting enemy's goods in neutral bottoms.
He cites the ordinance of France herself in 1744 and
her long continued practice under it; and he answers
so overwhelmingly the suggestion that the law of
nations had not been changed by the rules laid down
by the "Armed Neutrality" of the Northern Powers
of Europe in the war existing at the time of that
confederation, that the resourceful Talleyrand made
no pretense of answering it.</p>

<p>The stipulation in the Franco-American Treaty of
"protecting the goods of the enemy of either party
in the vessels of the other, and in turn surrendering
its own goods found in the vessels of the enemy,"
extended, Marshall insists, to no other nation except
to France and America; and contends that this could
be changed only by further specific agreements between
those two nations.</p>

<p>Marshall wishes "that the principle that neutral
bottoms shall make neutral goods" were universally
established, and declares that that principle "is perhaps
felt by no nation on earth more strongly than
by the United States." On this point he is emphatic,
and reiterates that "no nation is more deeply interested
in its establishment" than America. "It is an
object they [the United States] have kept in view, and
which, if not forced by violence to abandon it, they
will pursue in such manner as their own judgment
may dictate as being best calculated to attain it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," he says, "the wish to establish a principle
is essentially different from a determination
that it is already established.... However solicitous
America might be to pursue all proper means,
tending to obtain for this principle the assent of
any or all of the maritime Powers of Europe, she
never conceived the idea of attaining that consent
by force."<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> "The United States will only arm
to defend their own rights," declares Marshall;
"neither their policy nor their interests permit
them to arm, in order to compel a surrender of the
rights of others."</p>

<p>He then gives the history of the Jay Treaty, and
points out that Jay's particular instructions not to
preserve peace with Great Britain, "nor to receive
compensations for injuries sustained, nor security
against their future commission, at the expense of
the smallest of its [America's] engagements to
France,"<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> were incorporated in the treaty itself, in
the clause providing that "nothing in this treaty
shall, however, be construed or operate contrary to
former and existing public treaties with other sovereignties
or states."<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> So careful, in fact, was America
to meet the views of France that "previous to its
ratification" the treaty was submitted to the French
Minister to the United States, who did not even comment
on the article relating to enemy's goods in neutral
bottoms, but objected only to that enlarging
the list of contraband;<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> and the American Government
went to extreme lengths to meet the views of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
the French Minister, who finally appeared to be
satisfied.</p>

<p>The articles of contraband enumerated in the Jay
Treaty, to which the French Government objected,
says Marshall, were contraband by the laws of
nations and so admitted by France herself in her
treaties with other countries.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p>Answering the charge that in the treaty the United
States had agreed that more articles should be contraband
than she had in compacts with other Powers,
Marshall explains that "the United States, desirous
of liberating commerce, have invariably seized every
opportunity which presented itself to diminish or
remove the shackles imposed on that of neutrals. In
pursuance of this policy, they have on no occasion
hesitated to reduce the list of contraband, as between
themselves and any nation consenting to such
reduction. Their pre&euml;xisting treaties have been with
nations as willing as themselves to change this old
rule." But these treaties leave other governments,
who do not accept the American policy, "to the law
which would have governed had such particular
stipulation never been made"&mdash;that is, to the law
of nations.</p>

<p>Great Britain declined to accept this American
view of the freedom of the seas; and, therefore,
America was forced to leave that nation where it
had found her on the subject of contraband and
freedom of ocean-going commerce. Thus, contends
Marshall, the Jay Treaty "has not added to the
catalog of contraband a single article ... ceded no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
privilege ... granted no right," nor changed, in the
most minute circumstance, the pre&euml;xisting situation
of the United States in relation either to France or
to Great Britain. Notwithstanding these truths,
"the Government of the United States has hastened
to assure its former friend [France], that, if the
stipulations between them are found oppressive in
practice, it is ready to offer up those stipulations a
willing sacrifice at the shrine of friendship."<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>Stating the general purposes of the United States,
Marshall strikes at the efforts of France to compel
America to do what France wishes and in the manner
that France wishes, instead of doing what American
interests require and in the manner America thinks
wisest.</p>

<p>The American people, he asserts, "must judge
exclusively for themselves how far they will or
ought to go in their efforts to acquire new rights or
establish new principles. When they surrender this
privilege, they cease to be independent, and they will
no longer deserve to be free. They will have surrendered
into other hands the most sacred of deposits&mdash;the
right of self-government; and instead of approbation,
they will merit the contempt of the world."<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>Marshall states the economic and business reasons
why the United States, of all countries, must depend
upon commerce and the consequent necessity for
the Jay Treaty. He tartly informs Talleyrand that
in doing so the American Government was "transacting
a business exclusively its own." Marshall
denies the insinuation that the negotiations of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Jay Treaty had been unusually secret, but sarcastically
observes that "it is not usual for nations about
to enter into negotiations to proclaim to others the
various objects to which those negotiations may
possibly be directed. Such is not, nor has it ever
been, the principle of France." To suppose that
America owed such a duty to France, "is to imply
a dependence to which no Government ought willingly
to submit."<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>Marshall then sets forth specifically the American
complaints against the French Government,<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> and
puts in parallel columns the words of the Jay Treaty
to which the French objected, and the rules which
the French Directory pretended were justified by
that treaty. So strong is Marshall's summing up of
the case in these portions of the American memorial
that it is hard for the present-day reader to see how
even the French Directory of that lawless time could
have dared to attempt to withstand it, much less to
refuse further negotiations.</p>

<p>Drawing to a conclusion, Marshall permits a lofty
sarcasm to lighten his weighty argument. "America
has accustomed herself," he observes, "to perceive
in France only the ally and the friend. Consulting
the feelings of her own bosom, she [America] has
believed that between republics an elevated and
refined friendship could exist, and that free nations
were capable of maintaining for each other a real and
permanent affection. If this pleasing theory, erected
with so much care, and viewed with so much delight,
has been impaired by experience, yet the hope con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>tinues
to be cherished that this circumstance does
not necessarily involve the opposite extreme."<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p>

<p>Then, for a moment, Marshall indulges his eloquence:
"So intertwined with every ligament of her
heart have been the cords of affection which bound
her to France, that only repeated and continued acts
of hostility can tear them asunder."<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>Finally he tells Talleyrand that the American envoys,
"searching only for the means of effecting
the objects of their mission, have permitted no
personal considerations to influence their conduct,
but have waited, under circumstances beyond measure
embarrassing and unpleasant, with that respect
which the American Government has so uniformly
paid to that of France, for permission to lay before
you, citizen Minister, these important communications
with which they have been charged." But, "if
no such hope" remains, "they [the envoys] have
only to pray that their return to their own country
may be facilitated."<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p>But Marshall's extraordinary power of statement
and logic availed nothing with Talleyrand and the
Directory. "I consider Marshall, whom I have
heard speak on a great subject,<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> as one of the most
powerful reasoners I ever met with either in public
or in print," writes William Vans Murray from The
Hague, commenting on the task of the envoys.
"Reasoning in such cases will have a fine effect in
America, but to depend upon it in Europe is really to
place Quixote with Gin&eacute;s de Passamonte and among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
the men of the world whom he reasoned with, and so
sublimely, on their way to the galleys. They answer
him, with you know stones and blows, though the
Knight is an <i>armed</i> as well as an eloquent Knight."<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></p>

<p>The events which had made Marshall and Pinckney
more resolute in demanding respectful treatment
had made Gerry more pliant to French influence.
"Mr. Gerry is to see Mr. Talleyrand the day after
to-morrow. Three appointments have been made
by that gentleman," Marshall notes in his Journal,
"each of which Mr. Gerry has attended and each
of which Mr. Talleyrand has failed to attend; nor
has any apology for these disappointments been
thought necessary."<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> Once more Gerry waits on
Talleyrand, who remains invisible.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> And now again
Beaumarchais appears. The Directory issues more
and harsher decrees against American commerce.
Marshall's patience becomes finite. "I prepared to-day
a letter to the Minister remonstrating against
the decree, ... subjecting to confiscation all neutral
vessels having on board any article coming out of
England or its possessions." The letter closes by
"requesting our passports."<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Marshall's memorial of the American case remained
unread. One of Talleyrand's many secretaries
asked Gerry "what it contained? (for they
could not take the trouble to read it) and he added
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>that such long letters were not to the taste of the
French Government who liked a short address coming
straight to the point."<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> Gerry, who at last saw
Talleyrand, "informed me [Marshall] that communications
&amp; propositions had been made to him by that
Gentleman, which he [Gerry] was not at liberty to
impart to Genl Pinckney or myself." Upon the outcome
of his secret conferences with Talleyrand, said
Gerry, "probably depended peace or war."<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>Gerry's "communication necessarily gives birth
to some very serious reflections," Marshall confides
to his Journal. He recalls the attempts to frighten
the envoys "from our first arrival"&mdash;the threats
of "a variety of ills ... among others with being
ordered immediately to quit France," none of them
carried out; "the most haughty &amp; hostile conduct ... towards us &amp; our country and
yet ... an unwillingness ... to profess the war which is in fact
made upon us."<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>A French agent, sent by the French Consul-General
in America, just arrived in Paris, "has
probably brought with him," Marshall concludes,
"accurate details of the state of parties in America....
I should think that if the French Government
continues its hostility and does not relax some
little in its hauteur its party in the United States will
no longer support it. I suspect that some intelligence
of this complexion has been received ... whether
she [France] will be content to leave us our
Independence if she can neither cajole or frighten us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
out of it or will even endeavor to tear it from us by
open war there can be no doubt of her policy in one
respect&mdash;she will still keep up and cherish, if it be
possible, ... her party in the United States." Whatever
course France takes, Marshall thinks will be
"with a view to this her primary object."</p>

<p>Therefore, reasons Marshall, Talleyrand will maneuver
to throw the blame on Pinckney and himself
if the mission fails, and to give Gerry the credit
if it succeeds. "I am led irresistibly by this train
of thought to the opinion that the communication
made to Mr. Gerry in secret is a proposition to furnish
passports to General Pinckney and myself and
to retain him for the purpose of negotiating the differences
between the two Republics." This would
give the advantage to the French party in any
event.</p>

<p>"I am firmly persuaded of his [Talleyrand's] unwillingness
to dismiss us while the war with England
continues in its present uncertain state. He believed
that Genl Pinckney and myself are both determined
to remain no longer unless we can be accredited."
Gerry had told Marshall that he felt the same way;
"but," says Marshall, "I am persuaded the Minister
[Talleyrand] does not think so. He would on this
account as well as on another which has been the
base of all propositions for an accommodation [the
loan and the bribe] be well pleased to retain only one
minister and to chuse that one [Gerry]."<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>Marshall and Pinckney decided to let Gerry go his
own gait. "We shall both be happy if, by remaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
without us, Mr. Gerry can negotiate a treaty which
shall preserve the peace without sacrificing the independence
of our country. We will most readily offer
up all personal considerations as a sacrifice to appease
the haughtiness of this Republic."<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></p>

<p>Marshall gave Gerry the letter on the decree and
passport question "and pressed his immediate attention
to it." But Gerry was too excited by his secret
conferences with Talleyrand to heed it. Time and
again Gerry, bursting with importance, was closeted
with the Foreign Minister, hinting to his colleagues
that he held peace or war in his hand. Marshall
bluntly told him that Talleyrand's plan now was
"only to prevent our taking decisive measures until
the affairs of Europe shall enable France to take
them. I have pressed him [Gerry] on the subject of
the letter concerning the Decree but he has not
yet read it."<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>Talleyrand and Gerry's "private intercourse still
continues," writes Marshall on February 10. "Last
night after our return from the Theatre Mr. Gerry
told me, just as we were separating to retire each to
his own apartment, that he had had in the course of
the day a very extraordinary conversation with" a
clerk of Talleyrand. It was, of course, secret. Marshall
did not want to hear it. Gerry said he could tell
his colleagues that it was on the subject of money.
Then, at last, Marshall's restraint gave way momentarily
and his anger, for an instant, blazed. Money
proposals were useless; Talleyrand was playing
with the Americans, he declared. "Mr. Gerry was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
a little warm and the conversation was rather unpleasant.
A solicitude to preserve harmony restrained
me from saying all I thought."<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

<p>Money, money, money! Nothing else would do!
Gerry, by now, was for paying it. No answer yet
comes to the American memorial delivered to Talleyrand
nearly three weeks before. Marshall packs his
belongings, in readiness to depart. An unnamed
person<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> calls on him and again presses for money;
France is prevailing everywhere; the envoys had
better yield; why resist the inevitable, with a thousand
leagues of ocean between them and home?
Marshall answers blandly but crushingly.</p>

<p>Again Talleyrand's clerk sees Gerry. The three
Americans that night talk long and heatedly. Marshall
opposes any money arrangement; Gerry urges
it "very decidedly"; while Pinckney agrees with
Marshall. Gerry argues long about the horrors of
war, the expense, the risk. Marshall presents the
justice of the American cause. Gerry reproaches
Marshall with being too suspicious. Marshall patiently
explains, as to a child, the real situation.
Gerry again charges Marshall and Pinckney with
undue suspicion. Marshall retorts that Gerry "could
not answer the argument but by misstating it." The
evening closes, sour and chill.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>The next night the envoys once more endlessly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
debate their course. Marshall finally proposes that
they shall demand a personal meeting with Talleyrand
on the real object of the mission. Gerry stubbornly
dissents and finally yields, but indulges in
long and childish discussion as to what should be said
to Talleyrand, confusing the situation with every
word.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> Talleyrand fixes March 2 for the interview.</p>

<p>The following day Marshall accidentally discovers
Gerry closeted with Talleyrand's clerk, who came
to ask the New Englander to attend Talleyrand "in
a particular conversation." Gerry goes, but reports
that nothing important occurred. Then it comes out
that Talleyrand had proposed to get rid of Marshall
and Pinckney and keep Gerry. Gerry admits it.
Thus Marshall's forecast made three weeks earlier<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>
is proved to have been correct.</p>

<p>At last, for the first time in five months, the three
envoys meet Talleyrand face to face. Pinckney
opens and Talleyrand answers. Gerry suggests a
method of making the loan, to which Talleyrand
gives qualified assent. The interview seems at an
end. Then Marshall comes forward and states the
American case. There is much parrying for an
hour.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>The envoys again confer. Gerry urges that their
instructions permit them to meet Talleyrand's demands.
He goes to Marshall's room to convince the
granite-like Virginian, who would not yield. "I told
him," writes Marshall, "that my judgment was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
more perfectly convinced that the floor was wood or
that I stood on my feet and not on my head than
that our instructions would not permit us to make
the loan required."<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> Let Gerry or Marshall or both
together return to America and get new instructions
if a loan must be made.</p>

<p>Two days later, another long and absurd discussion
with Gerry occurs. Before the envoys go to see
Talleyrand the next day, Gerry proposes to Marshall
that, with reference to President Adams's
speech, the envoys should declare, in any treaty
made, "that the complaints of the two governments
had been founded in mistake." Marshall hotly retorts:
"With my view of things, I should tell an
absolute lye if I should say that our complaints were
founded in mistake. He [Gerry] replied hastily and
with warmth that he wished to God, I would propose
something which was accommodating: that I
would propose nothing myself and objected to
every thing which he proposed. I observed that it
was not worth while to talk in that manner: that
it was calculated to wound but not to do good: that
I had proposed every thing which in my opinion
was calculated to accommodate differences on just
and reasonable grounds. He said that ... to talk
about justice was saying nothing: that I should
involve our country in a war and should bring it
about in such a manner, as to divide the people
among themselves. I felt a momentary irritation,
which I afterwards regretted, and told Mr. Gerry
that I was not accustomed to such language and did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
not permit myself to use it with respect to him or his
opinions."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Marshall, with characteristic patience,
once more begins to detail his reasons. Gerry
interrupts&mdash;Marshall "might think of him [Gerry]
as I [he] pleased." Marshall answers moderately.
Gerry softens and "the conversation thus ended."<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the bout between Marshall and
Gerry the envoys saw Talleyrand for a third time.
Marshall was dominant at this interview, his personality
being, apparently, stronger even than his
words. These were strong enough&mdash;they were,
bluntly, that the envoys could not and would not
accept Talleyrand's proposals.</p>

<p>A week later Marshall's client, Beaumarchais,
called on his American attorney with the alarming
news that "the effects of all Americans in France
were to be Sequestered." Pay the Government
money and avoid this fell event, was Beaumarchais's
advice; he would see Talleyrand and call again.
"Mr. Beaumarchais called on me late last evening,"
chronicles Marshall. "He had just parted from the
Minister. He informed me that he had been told
confidentially ... that the Directory were determined
to give passports to General Pinckney and
myself but to retain Mr. Gerry." But Talleyrand
would hold the order back for "a few days to give
us time to make propositions conforming to the
views of the Government," which "if not made
Mr. Talleyrand would be compelled to execute the
order."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>"I told him," writes Marshall, "that if the proposition ... was a loan it was perfectly unnecessary to
keep it [the order] up [back] a single day: that the
subject had been considered for five months" and
that the envoys would not change; "that for myself,
if it were impossible to effect the objects of our mission,
I did not wish to stay another day in France
and would as cheerfully depart the next day as at
any other time."<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>Beaumarchais argued and appealed. Of course,
France's demand was not just&mdash;Talleyrand did not
say it was; but "a compliance would be useful to our
country [America]." "France," said Beaumarchais,
"thought herself sufficiently powerful to give the
law to the world and exacted from all around her
money to enable her to finish successfully her war
against England."</p>

<p>Finally, Beaumarchais, finding Marshall flint,
"hinted" that the envoys themselves should propose
which one of them should remain in France, Gerry
being the choice of Talleyrand. Marshall countered.
If two were to return for instructions, the envoys
would decide that for themselves. If France was
to choose, Marshall would have nothing to do
with it.</p>

<p>"General Pinckney and myself and especially
me," said Marshall, "were considered as being sold
to the English." Beaumarchais admitted "that our
positive refusal to comply with the demands of
France was attributed principally to me who was
considered as entirely English.... I felt some little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
resentment and answered that the French Government
thought no such thing; that neither the government
nor any man in France thought me English:
but they knew I was not French: they knew I would
not sacrifice my duty and the interest of my country
to any nation on earth, and therefore I was not a
proper man to stay, and was branded with the epithet
of being English: that the government knew
very well I loved my own country exclusively, and
it was impossible to suppose any man who loved
America, fool enough to wish to engage her in a war
with France if that war was avoidable."</p>

<p>Thus Marshall asserted his purely American attitude.
It was a daring thing to do, considering the
temper of the times and the place where he then
was. Even in America, at that period, any one who
was exclusively American and, therefore, neutral, as
between the European belligerents, was denounced
as being British at heart. Only by favoring France
could abuse be avoided. And to assert Neutrality
in the French Capital was, of course, even more
dangerous than to take this American stand in the
United States.</p>

<p>But Beaumarchais persisted and proposed to take
passage with his attorney to America; not on a public
mission, of course (though he had hinted at wishing
to "reconcile" the two governments), but merely
"to testify," writes Marshall, "to the moderation of
my conduct and to the solicitude I had uniformly
expressed to prevent a rupture with France."</p>

<p>Beaumarchais "hinted very plainly," continues
Marshall, "at what he had before observed that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
means would be employed to irritate the people of
the United States against me and that those means
would be successful. I told him that I was much
obliged to him but that I relied entirely on my conduct
itself for its justification and that I felt no sort
of apprehension for consequences, as they regarded
me personally; that in public life considerations of
that sort never had and never would in any degree
influence me. We parted with a request, on his part,
that, whatever might arise, we would preserve the
most perfect temper, and with my assuring him of
my persuasion that our conduct would always manifest
the firmness of men who were determined, and
never the violence of passionate men."</p>

<p>"I have been particular," concludes Marshall, "in
stating this conversation, because I have no doubt of
its having been held at the instance of the Minister
[Talleyrand] and that it will be faithfully reported to
him. I mentioned to-day to Mr. Gerry that the Government
wished to detain him and send away General
Pinckney and myself. He said he would not
stay; but I find I shall not succeed in my efforts
to procure a Serious demand of passports for Mr.
Gerry and myself."<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>During his efforts to keep Gerry from dangerously
compromising the American case, and while
waiting for Talleyrand to reply to his memorial,
Marshall again writes to Washington a letter giving
a survey of the war-riven and intricate European
situation. He tells Washington that, "before
this reaches you it will be known universally in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
America<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> that scarcely a hope remains of" honorable
adjustment of differences between France and
America; that the envoys have not been and will not
be "recognized" without "acceding to the demands
of France ... for money&mdash;to be used in the
prosecution of the present war"; that according to
"reports," when the Directory makes certain that
the envoys "will not add a loan to the mass of
American property already in the hands of this
[French] government, they will be ordered out of
France and a nominal [formally declared] as well as
actual war will be commenc'd against the United
States."<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>Marshall goes on to say that his "own opinion has
always been that this depends on the state of war
with England"; the French are absorbed in their
expected attack on Great Britain; "and it is perhaps
justly believed that on this issue is stak'd the
independence of Europe and America." He informs
Washington of "the immense preparations for an
invasion" of England; the "numerous and veteran
army lining the coast"; the current statement that
if "50,000 men can be" landed "no force in England
will be able to resist them"; the belief that "a
formidable and organized party exists in Britain,
ready, so soon as a landing shall be effected, to rise
and demand a reform"; the supposition that England
then "will be in ... the situation of the bata<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>vian
and cisalpine republics and that its wealth, its
commerce, and its fleets will be at the disposition
of this [French] government."</p>

<p>But, he continues, "this expedition is not without
its hazards. An army which, arriving safe, would
sink England, may itself be ... sunk in the channel....
The effect of such a disaster on a nation already
tir'd of the war and groaning under ... enormous
taxation" and, intimates Marshall, none too warm
toward the "existing arrangements ... might be
extremely serious to those who hold the reins of government"
in France. Many intelligent people therefore
think, he says, that the "formidable military
preparations" for the invasion of England "cover
and favor secret negotiations for peace." This view
Marshall himself entertains.</p>

<p>He then briefly informs Washington of Bonaparte's
arrangement with Austria and Prussia which
will "take from England, the hope of once more
arming" those countries "in her favor," "influence
the secret [French] negotiations with England,"
and greatly affect "Swisserland." Marshall then
gives an extended account of the doings and purposes
of the French in Switzerland, and refers to
revolutionary activities in Sardinia, Naples, and
Spain.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the obstacles in its way, he
concludes that "the existing [French] government ... needs only money to enable it to effect all its
objects. A numerous brave and well disciplined
army seems to be devoted to it. The most military
and the most powerful nation on earth [the French]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
is entirely at its disposal.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> Spain, Italy, and Holland,
with the Hanseatic towns, obey its mandates."</p>

<p>But, says he, it is hard to "procure funds to
work this vast machine. Credit being annihilated ... the enormous contributions made by foreign nations,"
together with the revenue from imposts, are
not enough to meet the expenses; and, therefore,
"France is overwhelmed with taxes. The proprietor
complains that his estate yields him nothing. Real
property pays in taxes nearly a third of its produce
and is greatly reduc'd in its price."<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>While Marshall was thus engaged in studying
French conditions and writing his long and careful
report to Washington, Talleyrand was in no hurry
to reply to the American memorial. Indeed, he did
not answer until March 18, 1798, more than six
weeks after receiving it. The French statement
reached Marshall and Pinckney by Gerry's hands,
two days after its date. "Mr. Gerry brought in,
just before dinner, a letter from the Minister of
exterior relations," writes Marshall, "purporting to
be an answer to our long memorial criminating in
strong terms our government and ourselves, and
proposing that two of us should go home leaving
for the negotiation the person most acceptable to
France. The person is not named but no question
is entertained that Mr. Gerry is alluded to. I read
the letter and gave it again to Mr. Gerry."<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day the three envoys together read Talleyrand's
letter. Gerry protests that he had told the
French Foreign Minister that he would not accept
Talleyrand's proposal to stay, "That," sarcastically
writes Marshall, "is probably the very reason why
it was made." Talleyrand's clerk calls on Gerry the
next morning, suggesting light and innocent duties
if he would remain. No, theatrically exclaims Gerry,
I "would sooner be thrown into the Seine."<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> But
Gerry remained.</p>

<p>It is impossible, without reading Talleyrand's
answer in full, to get an idea of the weak shiftiness to
which that remarkable man was driven in his reply
to Marshall. It was, as Pinckney said, "weak in
argument, but irritating and insulting in style."<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
The great diplomat complains that the Americans
have "claimed the right to take cognizance of the
validity of prizes carried into the ports of the United
States by French cruisers"; that the American Government
permitted "any vessels to put into the ports
of the United States after having captured the property
of ships belonging to French citizens"; that "a
French corvette had anchored at Philadelphia and
was seized by the Americans"; and that the Jay
Treaty was hostile to France.</p>

<p>But his chief complaint was with regard to the
American newspapers which, said Talleyrand, "have
since the treaty redoubled the invectives and calumnies
against the [French] republic, and against her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
principles, her magistrates, and her envoys";<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> and
of the fact that the American Government might
have, but did not, repress "pamphlets openly paid
for by the Minister of Great Britain" which contained
"insults and calumnies." So far from the
American Government stopping all this, snarls Talleyrand,
it encouraged "this scandal in its public
acts" and, through its President, had denounced
the French Directory as endeavoring to propagate
anarchy and division within the United States.</p>

<p>Talleyrand then openly insults Marshall and
Pinckney by stating that it was to prevent the restoration
of friendship that the American Government
had sent "to the French republic persons
whose opinions and connections are too well known
to hope from them dispositions sincerely conciliatory."
Appealing directly to the French party in the
United States, he declares that he "does not hesitate
to believe that the American nation, like the
French nation, sees this state of affairs with regret,
and does not consider its consequences without
sorrow. He apprehends that the American people
will not commit a mistake concerning the prejudices
with which it has been desired to inspire them
against an allied people, nor concerning the engagements
which it seems to be wished to make them
contract to the detriment of an alliance, which so
powerfully contributed to place them in the rank
of nations, and to support them in it; and that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
will see in these new combinations the only dangers
their prosperity and importance can incur."<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>Finally, with cynical effrontery, Talleyrand actually
proposes that Gerry alone shall conduct the
negotiations. "Notwithstanding the kind of prejudice
which has been entertained with respect to
them [the envoys], the Executive Directory is disposed
to treat with that one of the three, whose
opinions, presumed to be more impartial, promise,
in the course of explanations, more of that reciprocal
confidence which is indispensable."<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p>Who should answer Talleyrand? Marshall, of
course. "It was agreed ... that I should ... prepare
an answer ... in which I should state that no
one of the ministers could consent to remain on a
business committed to all three."<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> In the discussion
leading to this decision, "I," writes Marshall, "was
perfectly silent." Again Dutrimond, a clerk of Talleyrand's,
calls on Gerry, but sees Marshall instead,
Gerry being absent.</p>

<p>Dutrimond's advice to Marshall is to leave France.
The truth is, he declares, that his chief must order
the envoys out of France "in three days at farthest."
But spare them Gerry; let him remain&mdash;all this in
polite terms and with plausible argument. "I told
him," relates Marshall, "that personally nothing
could be more desirable to me than to return immediately
to the United States."</p>

<p>Then go on your own initiative, urges Talleyrand's
clerk. Marshall grows evasive; for he wishes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Directory to order his departure. A long talk ensues.
Dutrimond leaves and Gerry returns. Marshall relates
what had passed. "To prevent war I will stay,"
exclaims Gerry. "I made no observation on this,"
dryly observes Marshall in his Journal.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>Beaumarchais again tries his luck with Marshall,
who replies that he will go home by "the direct passage
to America" if he can get safe-conduct, "tho'
I had private business of very considerable consequence
in England."<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Otherwise, declares Marshall,
"I should embark immediately for England." That
would never do, exclaims Beaumarchais; it would enrage
the Directory and subject Marshall to attacks
at home. Marshall remarks that he prefers to sail
direct, although he knows "that the captains of privateers
had received orders to cruise for us ... and
take us to the West Indies."<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>Beaumarchais sees Talleyrand and reports that
the Foreign Minister is horrified at the thought of
Marshall's returning by way of England; it would
"irritate this government" and delay "an accommodation";
it would blast Marshall's reputation; the
Directory "would immediately publish ... that I
was gone to England to receive the wages I had
earned by breaking off the treaty with France,"
Marshall records of the representations made to
him.</p>

<p>"I am entitled to safe conduct," cries Marshall;
and "the calumny threatened against myself is too
contemptible to be credited for a moment by those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
who would utter it." I "despise" it, exclaims the
insulted Virginian.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> Thus back and forth went this
fantastic dance of corrupt diplomacy and cautious
but defiant honesty.</p>

<p>At the long last, the interminable Gerry finished
his review of Marshall's reply to Talleyrand and
made a lengthy and unctuous speech to his colleagues
on the righteousness of his own motives.
Pinckney, intolerably bored and disgusted, told
Gerry what he thought of him. The New Englander
peevishly charged Marshall and Pinckney
with concealing their motives.</p>

<p>"It is false, sir," shouted Pinckney. Gerry, he
said, was the one who had concealed from his colleagues,
not only his purposes, but his clandestine
appointments with Talleyrand. Pinckney rode
Gerry hard, "and insisted in plain terms on the
duplicity which had been practiced [by Gerry] upon
us both." The latter ridiculously explained, evaded,
and, in general, acted according to the expectation of
those who warned Adams against his appointment.
Finally, however, Marshall's reply was signed by all
three and sent to Talleyrand.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>The calmness, dignity, and conclusiveness of
Marshall's rejoinder can be appreciated only by
reading the entire document. Marshall begins his
final statement of the American case and refutation
of the French claims by declaring what he had stated
before, that the American envoys "are ready to consider
and to compensate the injury, if the American
Government has given just cause of complaint to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
that of France"; and points out that the negotiations
which the American envoys had sought fruitlessly
for six months, if taken up even now, would "demonstrate
the sincerity of this declaration."<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> This offer
Marshall repeats again and again.</p>

<p>Before taking up Talleyrand's complaints in detail,
he states that if the envoys cannot convince
Talleyrand that the American Government is not in
the wrong on a single point Talleyrand mentions, the
envoys will prove their good faith; and thus, with an
offer to compensate France for any wrong, "a base
for an accommodation" is established. Every grievance
Talleyrand had made is then answered minutely
and at great length. History, reason, evidence,
march through these pages like infantry,
cavalry, and artillery going to battle. Marshall's
paper was irresistible. Talleyrand never escaped
from it.</p>

<p>In the course of it there is a passage peculiarly applicable
to the present day. Answering Talleyrand's
complaints about newspapers, Marshall says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The genius of the Constitution, and the opinions
of the people of the United States, cannot be overruled
by those who administer the Government.
Among those principles deemed sacred in America, ... there is no one ... more deeply impressed on
the public mind, than the liberty of the press. That
this liberty is often carried to excess, that it has sometimes
degenerated into licentiousness, is seen and
lamented; but the remedy has not been discovered.
Perhaps it is an evil inseparable from the good with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
which it is allied; perhaps it is a shoot which cannot
be stripped from the stalk, without wounding vitally
the plant from which it is torn."</p>

<p>At any rate, declares Marshall, there is, in America,
no redress for "the calumnies and invectives" of
the press except "legal prosecution in courts which
are alike open to all who consider themselves as injured.
Without doubt this abuse of a valuable privilege
is [a] matter of peculiar regret when it is extended
to the Government of a foreign nation." It
never is so extended "with the approbation of the
Government of the United States." But, he goes on
to say, this is unavoidable "especially on points respecting
the rights and interests of America, ... in
a nation where public measures are the results of
public opinion."</p>

<p>This practice of unrestricted criticism was not
directed toward France alone, Marshall assures
Talleyrand; "it has been lavished still more profusely
on its [France's] enemies and has even been
bestowed, with an unsparing hand, on the Federal
[American] Government itself. Nothing can be more
notorious than the calumnies and invectives with
which the wisest measures and most virtuous characters
of the United States have been pursued and
traduced [by American newspapers]." It is plain,
therefore, that the American Government cannot
influence the American press, the excesses of which
are, declares Marshall, "a calamity incident to the
nature of liberty."</p>

<p>He reminds Talleyrand that "the same complaint
might be urged on the part of the United States.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
You must well know what degrading and unworthy
calumnies against their Government, its principles,
and its officers, have been published to the world by
French journalists and in French pamphlets." Yet
America had not complained of "these calumnies,
atrocious as they are.... Had not other causes, infinitely
more serious and weighty, interrupted the
harmony of the two republics, it would still have
remained unimpaired and the mission of the undersigned
would never have been rendered necessary."<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p>Marshall again briefly sums up in broad outline
the injuries which the then French Government had
inflicted upon Americans and American property,
and finally declares: "It requires no assurance to
convince, that every real American must wish sincerely
to extricate his country from the ills it suffers,
and from the greater ills with which it is threatened;
but all who love liberty must admit that it does not
exist in a nation which cannot exercise the right of
maintaining its neutrality."</p>

<p>Referring to Talleyrand's desire that Gerry remain
and conduct the negotiations, Marshall remarks that
the request "is not accompanied by any assurances
of receding from those demands of money heretofore
made the consideration on which alone the cessation
of hostility on American commerce could be obtained."
No one of the three American envoys had
power to act alone, he maintains. In spite of neglect
and insult Marshall still hopes that negotiations
may begin; but if that is impossible, he asks for passports
and safe-conduct.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall made his final preparations for sailing,
in order, he says, "that I might be in readiness to
depart so soon as the will of the government should
be signified to me." He was so hurried, he declares,
that "I could not even lay in a moderate stock of
wine or send my foul linen to be washed."<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> The
now inescapable Beaumarchais saw Marshall again
and told him that Talleyrand said that "I [Marshall]
was no foreign minister; that I was to be considered
as a private American citizen, to obtain my
passport in the manner pursued by all others
through the Consul ... I must give my name,
stature, age, complexion, &amp;c., to our Consul."</p>

<p>Marshall answered with much heat. Beaumarchais
conferred with Talleyrand, taking Marshall's
side. Talleyrand was obdurate and said that "he
was mistaken in me [Marshall]; that I prevented all
negotiation and that so soon as I was gone the negotiation
would be carried on; that in America I
belonged to the English faction, which universally
hated and opposed the French faction; that all I
sought for was to produce a rupture in such a manner
as to throw the whole blame on France." Marshall
replied that Talleyrand "endeavored to make
our situation more unpleasant than his orders
required, in order to gratify his personal feelings,"
and he flatly refused to leave until ordered to go.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p>Finally Marshall and Pinckney received their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
passports. Pinckney, whose daughter was ill and
could leave France at that time only at the risk of
her life, had serious difficulty in getting permission
to stay in the south of France. On April 24, Marshall
sailed for home. It is characteristic of the man that,
notwithstanding his humiliating experiences and the
failure of the mission, he was neither sour nor depressed.
He had made many personal friends in
Paris; and on taking ship at Bordeaux he does not
forget to send them greetings, singling out Madame
de Villette for a gay message of farewell. "Present
me to my friends in Paris," he writes the American
Consul-General at the French Capital, "&amp; have the
goodness to say to Madam Vilette in my name &amp; in
the handsomest manner, every thing which respectful
friendship can dictate. When you have done that
You will have rendered not quite half justice to my
sentiments."<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></p>

<p>Gerry, to whom Pinckney and Marshall did not
even bid farewell,<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> remained in Paris, "extremely
miserable."<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> Infinitely disgusted, Pinckney writes
King that Gerry, "as I suspected, is resolved to
remain here," notwithstanding Pinckney's "warm
remonstrances with him on the bad consequences ... of such conduct and on the impropriety of"
his secret "correspondence with Talleyrand under
injunction not to communicate it to his colleagues."
Pinckney says: "I have made great sacrifices of my
feelings to preserve union; but in vain. I never met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
with a man of less candour and so much duplicity
as Mr. Gerry. General Marshall is a man of extensive
ability, of manly candour, and an honest
heart."<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

Madame de Villette, the celebrated Belle and Bonne of Voltaire."
(Lyman: <i>Diplomacy of the United States</i>, ii, footnote to 336.) Lyman
says that "as to the lady an intimation is given that that part of
the affair was not much to the credit of the Americans." (And see
Austin: <i>Gerry</i>, ii, footnote to 202.) Madame de Villette was the
widow of a Royalist colonel. Her brother, an officer in the King's
service, was killed while defending Marie Antoinette. Robespierre proscribed
Madame de Villette and she was one of a group confined in
prison awaiting the guillotine, of whom only a few escaped. (<i>Ib.</i>)</p></div>

theatrical period. He is generally known to-day only as the author
of the operas, <i>The Barber of Seville</i> and the <i>Marriage of Figaro</i>. His
suit was to recover a debt for supplies furnished the Americans during
the Revolution. Silas Deane, for our Government, made the original
contract with Beaumarchais. In addition to the contest before the
courts, in which Marshall was Beaumarchais's attorney, the matter
was before Congress three times during the claimant's life and,
through his heirs, twice after his death. In 1835 the case was settled
for 800,000 francs, which was nearly 2,500,000 francs less than
Alexander Hamilton, in an investigation, ordered by Congress, found
to be due the Frenchman; and 3,500,000 livres less than Silas Deane
reported that America owed Beaumarchais.
</p><p>
Arthur Lee, Beaumarchais's enemy, to whom Congress in 1787 left
the adjustment, had declared that the Frenchman owed the United
States two million francs. This prejudiced report was the cause of
almost a half-century of dispute, and of gross injustice. (See Lom&eacute;nie:
<i>Beaumarchais et son temps</i>; also, Channing, iii, 283, and references
in the footnote; and Perkins: <i>France in the American Revolution</i>.
Also see Henry to Beaumarchais, Jan. 8, 1785; Henry, iii, 264, in
which Henry says: "I therefore feel myself gratified in seeing, as I
think, ground for hope that yourself, and those worthy and suffering
of ours in your nation, who in so friendly a manner advanced their
money and goods when we were in want, will be satisfied that nothing
has been omitted which lay in our power towards paying them.")</p></div>

<h3>THE TRIUMPHANT RETURN</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The present crisis is the most awful since the days of Vandalism. (Robert
Troup.)</p>

<p>Millions for defense but not one cent for tribute. (Toast at banquet to
Marshall.)</p>

<p>We shall remain free if we do not deserve to be slaves. (Marshall to citizens
of Richmond.)</p>

<p>What a wicked use has been made of the X. Y. Z. dish cooked up by Marshall.
(Jefferson.)</p></div>


<p>While Talleyrand's drama of shame was enacting
in Paris, things were going badly for the American
Government at home. The French party in America,
with whose wrath Talleyrand's male and female
agents had threatened our envoys, was quite as powerful
and aggressive against President Adams as the
French Foreign Office had been told that it was.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the hazard and delay of ocean
travel,<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> Talleyrand managed to communicate at
least once with his sympathizers in America, whom
he told that the envoys' "pretensions are high, that
possibly no arrangement may take place, but that
there will be no declaration of war by France."<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson was alert for news from Paris. "We have
still not a word from our Envoys. This long silence
(if they have been silent) proves things are not going
on very roughly. If they have not been silent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
it proves their information, if made public, would
check the disposition to arm."<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> He had not yet received
the letter written him March 17, by his agent,
Skipwith. This letter is abusive of the Administration
of Washington as well as of that of Adams.
Marshall was "one of the declaiming apostles of
Jay's Treaty"; he and Pinckney courted the enemies
of the Revolutionary Government; and Gerry's
"paralytic mind" was "too weak" to accomplish
anything.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>The envoys' first dispatches, sent from Paris October
22, 1797, reached Philadelphia on the night of
March 4, 1798.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> These documents told of the corrupt
French demands and machinations. The next
morning President Adams informed Congress of
their arrival.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> Two weeks later came the President's
startling message to Congress declaring that the
envoys could not succeed "on terms compatible
with the safety, the honor, or the essential interests
of the nation" and "exhorting" Congress to prepare
for war.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans were dazed. White hot with
anger, Jefferson writes Madison that the President's
"insane message ... has had great effect. Exultation
on the one side &amp; a certainty of victory; while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the other [Republican] is petrified with astonishment."<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>
The same day he tells Monroe that the
President's "almost insane message" had alarmed
the merchants and strengthened the Administration;
but he did not despair, for the first move of the Republicans
"will be a call for papers [the envoys' dispatches].<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>
In Congress the battle raged furiously;
"the question of war &amp; peace depends now on
a toss of cross &amp; pile,"<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> was Jefferson's nervous
opinion.</p>

<p>But the country itself still continued French in
feeling; the Republicans were gaining headway even
in Massachusetts and Connecticut; Jefferson expected
the fall elections to increase the Republican
strength in the House; petitions against war measures
were pouring into Congress from every section;
the Republican strategy was to gain time. Jefferson
thought that "the present period, ... of two or
three weeks, is the most eventful ever known since
that of 1775."<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans, who controlled the House of
Representatives, demanded that the dispatches be
made public: they were sure that these papers would
not justify Adams's grave message. If the President
should refuse to send Congress the papers it would
demonstrate, said the "Aurora," that he "suspects
the popularity of his conduct if exposed to public
view.... If he thinks he has done right, why should
he be afraid of letting his measures be known?" Let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
the representatives of the people see "<i>the whole</i> of the
papers ... a <i>partial</i> communication would be worse
than none."<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p>Adams hesitated to reveal the contents of the dispatches
because of "a regard for the <i>personal safety</i>
of the Commissioners and an apprehension of the
effect of a disclosure upon our future diplomatic
intercourse."<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> High Federalist business men, to
whom an intimation of the contents of the dispatches
had been given, urged their publication. "We wish
much for the papers if they can with propriety be
made public" was Mason's reply to Otis. "The
Jacobins want them. And in the name of God let
them be gratified; it is not the first time they have
wished for the means of their destruction."<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p>Both Federalists who were advised and Republicans
who were still in the dark now were gratified
in their wish to see the incessantly discussed and
mysterious message from the envoys. The effect
on the partisan maneuvering was as radical and
amusing as it is illuminative of partisan sincerity.
When, on April 3, the President transmitted to
Congress the dispatches thus far received, the Republicans
instantly altered their tactics. The dispatches
did not show that the negotiations were at
an end, said the "Aurora"; it was wrong, therefore,
to publish them&mdash;such a course might mean war.
Their publication was a Federalist trick to discredit
the Republican Party; and anyway Talleyrand was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
a monarchist, the friend of Hamilton and King. So
raged and protested the Republican organ.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<p>Troup thus reports the change: The Republicans,
he says, "were very clamorous for the publication
[of the dispatches] until they became acquainted
with the intelligence communicated. From that
moment they opposed publication, and finally they
carried a majority against the measure. The Senate
finding this to be the case instantly directed publication."<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
The President then transmitted to Congress
the second dispatch which had been sent from
Paris two weeks after the first. This contained Marshall's
superb memorial to Talleyrand. It was another
blow to Republican hopes.</p>

<p>The dispatches told the whole story, simply yet
with dramatic art. The names of Hottenguer, Bellamy,
and Hauteval were represented by the letters
X, Y, and Z,<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> which at once gave to this picturesque
episode the popular name that history has adopted.
The effect upon public opinion was instantaneous
and terrific.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> The first result, of course, was felt in
Congress. Vice-President Jefferson now thought it
his "duty to be silent."<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> In the House the Republi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>cans
were "thunderstruck."<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> Many of their boldest
leaders left for home; others went over openly to
the Federalists.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Marshall's disclosures "produced
such a shock on the republican mind, as has never
been seen since our independence," declared Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
He implored Madison to write for the public
an analysis of the dispatches from the Republican
point of view.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

<p>After recovering from his "shock" Jefferson tried
to make light of the revelations; the envoys had
"been assailed by swindlers," he said, "but that the
Directory knew anything of it is neither proved nor
probable." Adams was to blame for the unhappy
outcome of the mission, declared Jefferson; his
"speech is in truth the only obstacle to negotiation."<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
Promptly taking his cue from his master,
Madison asserted that the publication of the dispatches
served "more to inflame than to inform the
country." He did not think Talleyrand guilty&mdash;his
"conduct is scarcely credible. I do not allude to its
depravity, which, however heinous, is not without
example. Its unparalleled stupidity is what fills me
with astonishment."<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>The hot-blooded Washington exploded with anger.
He thought "the measure of infamy was filled" by
the "profligacy ... and corruption" of the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Directory; the dispatches ought "to open the eyes
of the blindest," but would not "change ... the
<i>leaders</i> of the opposition unless there shou'd appear
a manifest desertion of the followers."<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> Washington
believed the French Government "capable [of] any
thing bad" and denounced its "outrageous conduct ... toward the United States"; but he was even
more wrathful at the "inimitable conduct of its
partisans [in America] who aid and abet their measures."
He concluded that the Directory would
modify their defiant attitude when they found "the
spirit and policy of this country rising with resistance
and that they have falsely calculated upon
support from a large part of the people thereof."<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p>Then was heard the voice of the country. "The
effects of the publication [of the dispatches] ... on
the people ... has been prodigious.... The leaders
of the opposition ... were astonished &amp; confounded
at the profligacy of their beloved friends
the French."<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> In New England, relates Ames, "the
Jacobins [Republicans] were confounded, and the
trimmers dropt off from the party, like windfalls
from an apple tree in September."<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> Among all classes
were observed "the most magical effects"; so "irresistible
has been the current of public opinion ...
that ... it has broken down the opposition in Congress."<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>
Jefferson mournfully informed Madison
that "the spirit kindled up in the towns is wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>ful....
Addresses ... are pouring in offering life &amp;
fortune."<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Long afterwards he records that the
French disclosures "carried over from us a great
body of the people, real republicans &amp; honest men,
under virtuous motives."<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> In New England, especially,
the cry was for "open and deadly war with
France."<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> From Boston Jonathan Mason wrote
Otis that "war for a time we must have and our
fears ... are that ... you [Congress] will rise without
a proper <i>climax</i>.... We pray that decisive
orders may be given and that accursed Treaty [with
France] may be annulled.... The time is now
passed, when we should fear giving offense.... The
yeomanry are not only united but spirited."<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a></p>

<p>Public meetings were held everywhere and "addresses
from all bodies and descriptions of men"
poured "like a torrent on the President and both
Houses of Congress."<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> The blood of Federalism was
boiling. "We consider the present crisis as the most
awful since the days of Vandalism," declared the
ardent Troup.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> "Yankee Doodle," "Stony Point,"
"The President's March," supplanted in popular
favor "&Ccedil;a ira" and the "Marseillaise," which had
been the songs Americans best loved to sing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>The black cockade, worn by patriots during the
Revolutionary War, suddenly took the place of the
French cockade which until the X. Y. Z. disclosures
had decorated the hats of the majority in American
cities. The outburst of patriotism produced many
songs, among others Joseph Hopkinson's "Hail
Columbia!" ("The President's March"), which,
from its first presentation in Philadelphia, caught
the popular ear. This song is of historic importance,
in that it expresses lyrically the first distinctively
National consciousness that had appeared among
Americans. Everywhere its stirring words were
sung. In cities and towns the young men formed
American clubs after the fashion of the democratic
societies of the French party.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Hail, Columbia! happy land!<br />
Hail, ye heroes! heaven-born band!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who fought and bled in Freedom's cause,"&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">sang these young patriots, and "Hail, Columbia!"
chanted the young women of the land.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> On every
hilltop the fires of patriotism were signaling devotion
and loyalty to the American Government.</p>

<p>Then came Marshall. Unannounced and unlooked
for, his ship, the Alexander Hamilton, had
sailed into New York Harbor after a voyage of fifty-three
days from Bordeaux.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> No one knew of his
coming. "General Marshall arrived here on Sunday
last. His arrival was unexpected and his stay with us
was very short. I have no other apology to make,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
writes Troup, "for our not giving him a public
demonstration of our love and esteem."<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> Marshall
hurried on to Philadelphia. Already the great
memorial to Talleyrand and the brilliantly written
dispatches were ascribed to his pen, and the belief
had become universal that the Virginian had proved
to be the strong and resourceful man of the mission.</p>

<p>On June 18, 1798, he entered the Capital, through
which, twenty years before, almost to a day, he had
marched as a patriot soldier on the way to Monmouth
from Valley Forge. Never before had any
American, excepting only Washington, been received
with such demonstration.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> Fleets of carriages
filled with members of Congress and prominent citizens,
and crowds of people on horseback and on
foot, went forth to meet him.</p>

<p>"The concourse of citizens ... was immense."
Three corps of cavalry "in full uniform" gave a
warlike color to the procession which formed behind
Marshall's carriage six miles out from Philadelphia.
"The occasion cannot be mentioned on which so
prompt and general a muster of the cavalry ever before
took place." When the city was reached, the
church bells rang, cannon thundered, and amid
"the shouts of the exulting multitudes" Marshall
was "escorted through the principal streets to the
city Tavern." The leading Federalist newspaper,
the "Gazette of the United States," records that,
"even in the Northern Liberties,<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> where the demons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
of anarchy and confusion are attempting to organize
treason and death, repeated shouts of applause
were given as the cavalcade approached and passed
along."<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> The next morning O'Ellers Tavern was
thronged with Senators and Representatives and
"a numerous concourse of respectable citizens" who
came to congratulate Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a></p>

<p>The "Aurora" confirms this description of its
Federalist rival; but adds bitterly: "What an occasion
for rejoicing! Mr. Marshall was sent to
France for the <i>ostensible</i> purpose, at least, of effecting
an amicable accommodation of differences. He
returns without having accomplished that object,
and on his return the Tories rejoice. This certainly
looks as if they did not wish him to succeed....
Many pensive and melancholy countenances gave
the glare of parade a gloom much more suited to the
occasion, and more in unison with the feelings of
Americans. Well may they despond: For tho' the
patriotic Gerry may succeed in settling the differences
between the two countries&mdash;it is too certain
that his efforts can be of no avail when the late conduct
of our administration, and the unprecedented
intemperance of our chief executive magistrate is
known in Europe."<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson watched Marshall's home-coming with
keen anxiety. "We heard of the arrival of Marshall
at New York," he writes, "and I concluded to stay
&amp; see whether that circumstance would produce any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
new projects. No doubt he there received more than
hints from Hamilton as to the tone required to be
assumed.... Yet I apprehend he is not hot enough
for his friends."</p>

<p>With much chagrin he then describes what happened
when Marshall reached Philadelphia: "M.
was received here with the utmost &eacute;clat. The Secretary
of State &amp; many carriages, with all the city
cavalry, went to Frankfort to meet him, and on his
arrival here in the evening, the bells rung till late
in the night, &amp; immense crowds were collected to
see &amp; make part of the shew, which was circuitously
paraded through the streets before he was set down
at the city tavern." But, says Jefferson, "all this
was to secure him [Marshall] to their [the Administration's]
views, that he might say nothing which
would expose the game they have been playing.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>
Since his arrival I can hear nothing directly from
him."</p>

<p>Swallowing his dislike for the moment, Jefferson
called on Marshall while the latter was absent from
the tavern. "Thomas Jefferson presents his compliments
to General Marshall" ran the card he left.
"He had the honor of calling at his lodgings twice
this morning, but was so ^<sup>un</sup>lucky as to find that he
was out on both occasions. He wished to have
expressed in person his regret that a pre-engagement
for to-day which could not be dispensed with,
would prevent him the satisfaction of dining in
company with General Marshall, and therefore begs
leave to place here the expressions of that respect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
which in company with his fellow citizens he bears
him."<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a></p>

<p>Many years afterwards Marshall referred to the
adding of the syllable "un" to the word "lucky"
as one time, at least, when Jefferson came near telling
the truth.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> To this note Marshall returned a
reply as frigidly polite as Jefferson's:&mdash;</p>

<p>"J. Marshall begs leave to accompany his respectful
compliments to Mr. Jefferson with assurances of
the regret he feels at being absent when Mr. Jefferson
did him the honor to call on him.</p>

<p>"J. Marshall is extremely sensible to the obliging
expressions contained in Mr. Jefferson's polite billet
of yesterday. He sets out to-morrow for Winchester
&amp; would with pleasure charge himself with any commands
of Mr. Jefferson to that part of Virginia."<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>Having made his report to the President and
Secretary of State, Marshall prepared to start for
Virginia. But he was not to leave without the highest
compliment that the Administration could, at
that time, pay him. So gratified were the President,
Cabinet, and Federalist leaders in Congress with
Marshall's conduct in the X. Y. Z. mission, and so
high their opinion of his ability, that Adams tendered
him the appointment to the place on the Supreme
Bench,<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> made vacant by the death of Justice
Wilson. Marshall promptly declined. After applying
to the Fairfax indebtedness all the money which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
might receive as compensation for his services in the
French mission, there would still remain a heavy
balance of obligation; and Marshall must devote all
his time and strength to business.</p>

<p>On the night before his departure, the members
of Congress gave the hero of the hour the historic
dinner at the city's principal tavern, "as an evidence
of their affection for his person and their
gratified approbation of the patriotic firmness with
which he sustained the dignity of his country during
his important mission." One hundred and twenty
enthusiastic men sat at the banquet table.</p>

<p>The Speaker of the National House, the members
of the Cabinet, the Justices of the Supreme Court,
the Speaker of the Pennsylvania State Senate, the
field officers of the army, the Right Reverend Bishops
Carroll and White, "and other distinguished
public characters attended." Toasts "were drank
with unbounded plaudits" and "many of them were
encored with enthusiasm." High rose the spirit of
Federalism at O'Eller's Tavern in Philadelphia that
night; loud rang Federalist cheers; copiously flowed
Federalist wine.</p>

<p>"Millions for Defense but not a cent for Tribute!"
was the crowning toast of that jubilant evening.
It expressed the spirit of the gathering; out over
the streets of Philadelphia rolled the huzzas that
greeted it. But its unknown author<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> "builded bet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>ter
than he knew." He did more than flatter Marshall
and bring the enthusiastic banqueters, wildly
shouting, to their feet: he uttered the sentiment of
the Nation. "Millions for Defense but not a cent
for Tribute" is one of the few historic expressions
in which Federalism spoke in the voice of America.
Thus the Marshall banquet in Philadelphia, June
18, 1798, produced that slogan of defiant patriotism
which is one of the slowly accumulating American
maxims that have lived.</p>

<p>After Marshall retired from the banquet hall, the
assemblage drank a final toast to "The man whom
his country delights to Honor."<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall was smothered with addresses, congratulations,
and every variety of attention from public
bodies and civic and military organizations. A committee
from the Grand Jury of Gloucester County,
New Jersey, presented the returned envoy a laudatory
address. His answer, while dignified, was somewhat
stilted, perhaps a trifle pompous. The Grand
Jury compliment was, said Marshall, "a sweet reward"
for his "exertions." The envoys wished,
above all things, for peace, but felt "that not even
peace was to be purchased at the price of national
independence."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<p>The officers of a militia brigade delivered to Marshall
a eulogy in which the war note was clear and
dominant. Marshall answered that, desirable as
peace is, it "ought not to have been bought by dishonor
and national degradation"; and that the resort
to the sword, for which the militia officers declared
themselves ready, made Marshall "feel with
an elevated pride the dignity and grandeur of the
American character."<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>The day before Marshall's departure from Philadelphia
the President, addressing Congress, said:
"I congratulate you on the arrival of General Marshall ... at a place of safety where he is justly held
in honor.... The negotiation may be considered at
an end. <i>I will never send another Minister to France
without assurances that he will be received, respected,
and honored as the representative of a great, free, powerful,
and independent nation.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> Bold and defiant
words expressive of the popular sentiment of the
hour; but words which were to be recalled later by
the enemies of Adams, to his embarrassment and
to the injury of his party.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>"Having heard that Mrs. Marshall is in Winchester
I shall immediately set out for that place,"<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>
Marshall writes Washington. His departure from
the Capital was as spectacular as his arrival. He
"was escorted by detachments of cavalry," says
the "Aurora." "Certainly nothing less was due
considering the distinguished services which he has
rendered by his mission&mdash;he has acquired some
knowledge of the French language,"<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> sneers that
partisan newspaper in good Republican fashion.
When Marshall approached Lancaster he was met
by companies of "cavalry and uniformed militia"
which escorted him into the town, where he was
"welcomed by the discharges of artillery and the
ringing of bells."<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>His journey throughout Pennsylvania and Virginia,
repeating scenes of his welcome at Philadelphia
and Lancaster, ended at Richmond. There, among
his old neighbors and friends, the demonstrations
reached their climax. A long procession of citizens
went out to meet him. Again rang the cheers, again
the bells pealed, again the cannon thundered. And
here, to his townsmen and friends, Marshall, for
the first time, publicly opened his heart and told,
with emotion, what had befallen in France. In this
brief speech the Nationalist and fighting spirit,
which appears in all his utterances throughout his
entire life, flashes like a sword in battle.</p>

<p>Marshall cannot express his "emotions of joy"
which his return to Richmond has aroused; nor
"paint the sentiments of affection and gratitude
towards" his old neighbors. Nobody, he assures his
hearers, could appreciate his feelings who had not
undergone similar experiences.</p>

<p>The envoys, far from their country with no news
from their Government, were in constant anxiety,
says Marshall. He tells of their trials, of how they
had discharged their duty, of his exultation over the
spirit America was now displaying. "I rejoice that
I was not mistaken in the opinion I had formed of
my countrymen. I rejoice to find, though they know
how to estimate, and therefore seek to avoid the
horrors and dangers of war, yet they know also how
to value the blessings of liberty and national independence.
Peace would be purchased at too high a
price by bending beneath a foreign yoke" and such
a peace would be but brief; for "the nation thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
submitting would be soon involved in the quarrels
of its master.... We shall remain free if we do
not deserve to be slaves."</p>

<p>Marshall compares the governments of France and
America. To one who, like himself, is so accustomed
to real liberty that he "almost considers it as the
indispensable companion of man, a view of [French]
despotism," though "borrowing the garb usurping
the name of freedom," teaches "the solid safety
and real security" existing in America. The loss of
these "would poison ... every other joy." Without
them "freemen would turn with loathing and disgust
from every other comfort of life." To preserve
them, "all ... difficulties ought to be encountered."</p>

<p>Stand by "the government of your choice," urges
Marshall; its officials are from the people, "subject
in common with others to the laws they make," and
must soon return to the popular body "whose destiny
involves their own and in whose ruin they must
participate." This is always a good rule, but "it is
peculiarly so in a moment of peril like the present"
when "want of confidence in our government ... furnishes ... a foreign real enemy [France] those weapons
which have so often been so successfully used."<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

<p>The Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen, and Common
Council of Richmond presented Marshall with an
address of extravagant praise. "If reason and argument ... if integrity, candor, and the pure spirit
of conciliation" had met like qualities in France,
"smiling peace would have returned along with
you." But if Marshall had not brought peace, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
had warned America against a government "whose
touch is death." Perhaps he had even preserved
"our excellent constitution and ... our well earned
liberties." In answer Marshall said that he reciprocated
the "joy" of his "fellow citizens, neighbors,
and ancient friends" upon his return; that they were
right in thinking honorable peace with France was
impossible; and warned them against "the countless
dangers which lurk beneath foreign attachments."<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<p>Marshall had become a national hero. Known
before this time, outside of his own State, chiefly to
the eminent lawyers of America, his name now became
a household word in the remotest log cabins of
Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as in the residences
of Boston and New York. "Saving General Washington,
I believe the President, Pinckney, and Marshall
are the most popular characters now in our
country," Troup reported to King in London.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p>For the moment, only one small cloud appeared
upon the horizon of Marshall's popularity; but a
vicious flash blazed from it. Marshall went to Fredericksburg
on business and attended the little theater
at that place. The band of the local artillery
company furnished the music. A Philadelphia Federalist,
who happened to be present, ordered them
to play "The President's March" ("Hail, Columbia!").
Instantly the audience was in an uproar. So
violent did they become that "a considerable riot
took place." Marshall was openly insulted. Nor did
their hostility subside with Marshall's departure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
"The inhabitants of Fredericksburg waited," in
anxious expectation, for an especially hated Federalist
Congressman, Harper of South Carolina, to
pass through the town on his way home, with the
intention of treating him even more roughly.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a></p>

<p>With this ominous exception, the public demonstrations
for Marshall were warmly favorable. His
strength with the people was greater than ever. By
the members of the Federal Party he was fairly idolized.
This, the first formal party organization in our
history, was, as we have seen, in sorry case even
under Washington. The assaults of the Republicans,
directed by Jefferson's genius for party management,
had all but wrecked the Federalists. That great
party general had out-maneuvered his adversaries at
every point and the President's party was already
nearing the breakers.</p>

<p>The conduct of the French mission and the publication
of Marshall's dispatches and letters to Talleyrand
saved the situation for the moment. Those
whom Jefferson's consummate skill had won over
to the Republican Party returned by thousands to
their former party allegiance.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<p>Congress acted with belated decision. Our treaty
with France was abrogated; non-intercourse laws
passed; a provisional army created; the Navy
Department established; arsenals provided; the
building of warships directed. For a season our National
machinery was permitted to work with vigor
and effectiveness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>The voices that were wont to declaim the glories
of French democracy were temporarily silent. The
people, who but yesterday frantically cheered the
"libert&eacute;, &eacute;galit&eacute;, fraternit&eacute;" of Robespierre and
Danton, now howled with wrath at mention of republican
France. The pulpit became a tribune of
military appeal and ministers of the gospel preached
sermons against American "Jacobins."<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> Federalist
orators had their turn at assailing "despotism" with
rhetoric and defending "liberty" with eloquence;
but the French Government was now the international
villain whom they attacked.</p>

<p>"The struggle between Liberty and Despotism,
Government and Anarchy, Religion and Atheism,
has been gloriously decided.... France has been
foiled, and America is free. The elastick veil of Gallick
perfidy has been rent, ... the severing blow
has been struck." Our abrogation of the treaty with
France was "the completion of our Liberties, the
acme of our Independence ... and ... emancipated
us from the oppressive friendship of an ambitious,
malignant, treacherous ally." That act
evidenced "our nation's manhood"; our Government
was now "an Hercules, who, no longer amused
with the coral and bells of 'liberty and equality' ...
no longer willing to trifle at the <i>distaff</i> of a 'Lady
Negociator,' boldly invested himself in the <i>toga
virilis</i>."<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> Such was the language of the public platform;
and private expressions of most men were even
less restrained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>Denouncing "the Domineering Spirit and boundless
ambition of a nation whose Turpitude has set
<i>all objections</i>, divine &amp; human, at naught,"<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> Washington
accepted the appointment as Commander-in-Chief
of the newly raised army. "Huzza! Huzza!
Huzza! How transporting the fact! The great, the
good, the aged <span class="smcap">Washington</span> has said 'I am ready
again to go with my fellow citizens to the field of
battle in defense of the Liberty &amp; Independence
of my Country,'" ran a newspaper announcement,
typically voicing the popular heart.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>To Marshall's brother James, who had offered his
services as an aide-de-camp, Washington wrote that
the French "(although <i>I</i> conceive them capable of
<i>anything</i> that is unjust or dishonorable)" will not
"attempt a serious invasion of this country" when
they learn of "the preparation which [we] are making
to receive them." They have "made calculations
on false ground" in supposing that Americans
would not "support Independence and the Government
of their country <i>at every hazard</i>." Nevertheless,
"the highest possible obligation rests upon the
country to be prepared for the event as the most
effective means to avert the evil."<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> Military preparations
were active and conspicuous: On July 4,
New York City "resembles a camp rather than a
commercial port," testifies Troup.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>The people for the moment believed, with Marshall
and Washington, that we were on the brink
of war; had they known what Jefferson knew, their
apprehension would have been still keener. Reporting
from Paris, the French partisan Skipwith tells
Jefferson that, from motives of "commercial advantage
and aggrandisement" as well as of "vengeance,"
France will probably fall upon America. "Yes sir,
the moment is come that I see the fortunes, nay,
independence, of my country at hazard, and in the
hands of the most gigantic nation on earth.... Already,
the language of planting new colonies upon
the ... Mississippi is the language of Frenchmen
here."<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> Skipwith blames this predicament upon
Adams's character, speech, and action and upon
Marshall's and Pinckney's conduct in Paris;<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> and
advises Jefferson that "war may be prevented, and
our country saved" by "modifying or breaking" the
Jay Treaty and lending money to France.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson was frantic with disappointment and
anger. Not only did he see the Republican Party,
which he had built up with such patience and skill,
going to pieces before his very eyes; but the prospect
of his election to the Presidency as the successor of
Adams, which until then appeared to be inviting,
now jeopardized if not made hopeless. With his
almost uncanny understanding of men, Jefferson laid
all this to Marshall; and, from the moment of his
fellow Virginian's arrival from France, this captain
of the popular cause began that open and malignant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
warfare upon Marshall which ended only with Jefferson's
last breath.</p>

<p>At once he set out to repair the havoc which Marshall's
work had wrought in his party. This task was
made the harder because of the very tactics which
Jefferson had employed to increase the Republican
strength. For, until now, he had utilized so thoroughly
the deep and widespread French sentiment in
America as his immediate party weapon, and made
so emphatic the French issue as a policy of party
tactics, that, in comparison, all other issues, except
the central one of States' Rights, were secondary in
the public mind at this particular time.</p>

<p>The French propaganda had gone farther than Jefferson,
perhaps, intended it to go. "They [the French]
have been led to believe by their agents and Partisans
amongst <i>us</i>," testifies Washington, "that we
are a divided people, that the latter are opposed to
their own Government."<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> At any rate, it is certain
that a direct connection, between members of what
the French politicians felt themselves justified in
calling "the French party" in America and the manipulators
of French public opinion, existed and was
made use of. This is shown by the effect in France of
Jefferson's famous letter to Mazzei of April 24,
1796.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> It is proved by the amazing fact that Talleyrand's
answer to the memorial of the envoys was
published in the Jeffersonian organ, the "Aurora,"
before Adams had transmitted that document to
Congress, if not indeed before the President himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
had received from our envoys Talleyrand's reply to
Marshall's statement of the American case.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson took the only step possible to a party
leader. He sought to minimize the effect of the disclosures
revealed in Marshall's dispatches. Writing
to Peter Carr, April 12, 1798, Jefferson said: "You
will perceive that they [the envoys] have been assailed
by swindlers, whether with or without the
participation of Talleyrand is not very apparent....
That the Directory knew anything of it is neither
proved nor probable."<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> On June 8, 1798, Jefferson
wrote to Archibald Stuart: "It seems fairly presumable
that the douceur of 50,000 Guineas mentioned in
the former dispatches was merely from X. and Y. as
not a word is ever said by Talleyrand to our envoys
nor by them to him on the subject."<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Thus Jefferson's
political desperation caused him to deny facts
which were of record, for the dispatches show, not
only that Talleyrand had full knowledge of the disgraceful
transaction, but also that he originated and
directed it.</p>

<p>The efforts of the Republicans to sneer away the
envoys' disclosures awakened Washington's bitter
sarcasm. The Republicans were "thunder-stricken ... on
the publication of the dispatches from our
envoys," writes he, "but the contents of these dispatches
are now resolved by them into harmless chitchat&mdash;mere
trifles&mdash;less than was or ought to have
been expected from the misconduct of the Adminis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>tration
of this country, and that it is better to
submit to such chastisement than to hazard greater
evils by shewing futile resentment."<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson made no headway, however, in his attempts
to discredit the X. Y. Z. revelations. Had the
Federalists stopped with establishing the Navy Department
and providing for an army, with Washington
at its head; had they been content to build ships
and to take other proper measures for the National
defense, Adams's Administration would have been
saved, the Federalist Party kept alive for at least
four years more, the Republican Party delayed in its
recovery and Jefferson's election to the Presidency
made impossible. Here again Fate worked, through
the blindness of those whose day had passed, the
doom of Federalism. The Federalists enacted the
Alien and Sedition Laws and thus hastened their
own downfall.</p>

<p>Even after this legislation had given him a new,
real, and irresistible "issue," Jefferson still assailed
the conduct of Marshall and Pinckney; he was resolved
that not a single Republican vote should be
lost. Months later he reviews the effect of the X.
Y. Z. disclosures. When the envoys were appointed,
he asserts, many "suspected ... from what was
understood of their [Marshall's and Pinckney's] dispositions,"
that the mission would not only fail,
but "widen the breach and provoke our citizens to
consent to a war with" France "&amp; union with England."
While the envoys were in Paris the Adminis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>tration's
hostile attitude toward France alarmed
the people; "meetings were held ... in opposition
to war"; and the "example was spreading like a
wildfire."</p>

<p>Then "most critically for the government [Administration],"
says Jefferson, "the dispatches ... prepared
by ... Marshall, with a view to their being
made public, dropped into their laps. It was truly
a God-send to them &amp; they made the most of it.
Many thousands of copies were printed &amp; dispersed
gratis, at the public expense; &amp; the zealots for war
co-operated so heartily, that there were instances of
single individuals who printed &amp; dispersed 10. or
12,000 copies at their own expense. The odiousness
of the corruption supposed in those papers excited a
general &amp; high indignation among the people."</p>

<p>Thus, declares Jefferson, the people, "unexperienced
in such maneuvers," did not see that the whole
affair was the work of "private swindlers" unauthorized
by "the French government of whose participation
there was neither proof nor probability." So
"the people ... gave a loose [tongue] to" their
anger and declared "their honest preference of war
to dishonor. The fever was long &amp; successfully kept
up and ... war measures as ardently crowded."<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson's deep political sagacity did not underestimate
the revolution in the thought and feelings
of the masses produced by the outcome of the
French mission; and he understood, to a nicety,
the gigantic task which must be performed to
reassemble and solidify the shattered Republican<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
ranks. For public sentiment was, for the time being,
decidedly warlike. "We will pay tribute to no nation; ... We
shall water our soil with our blood ... before
we yield,"<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> was Troup's accurate if bombastic
statement of the popular feeling.</p>

<p>When the first ship with American newspapers
containing the X. Y. Z. dispatches reached London,
they were at once "circulated throughout Europe,"<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>
and "produced everywhere much sensation favorable
to the United States and hostile to France."<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
The intimates of Talleyrand and the Directory were
"disappointed and chagrined.... Nothing can exceed
the rage of the apostate Americans, who have
so long misrepresented and disgraced their country
at Paris."<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> From the first these self-expatriated
Americans had flattered Gerry and sent swarms of
letters to America about the good intentions of the
Directory.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a></p>

<p>American diplomatic representatives abroad were
concerned over Gerry's whimsical character and
conduct. "Gerry is yet in Paris!... I ... fear ... that
man's more than infantine weakness. Of it
you cannot have an idea, unless you had seen him
here [The Hague] and at Paris. Erase all the two
lines above; it is true, but it is cruel. If they get
hold of him they will convert him into an innocent
baby-engine against the government."<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>And now Gerry, with whom Talleyrand had been
amusing himself and whose conceit had been fed
by American partisans of France in Paris, found
himself in sorry case. Talleyrand, with cynical audacity,
in which one finds much grim humor, peremptorily
demands that Gerry tell him the names of
the mysterious "X., Y., and Z." With comic self-abasement,
the New Englander actually writes
Talleyrand the names of the latter's own agents
whom Gerry had met in Talleyrand's presence and
who the French Minister personally had informed
Gerry were dependable men.</p>

<p>The Federalists made the most of Gerry's remaining
in Paris. Marshall told them that Gerry had
"suffered himself to be wheedled in Paris."<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> "I ... rejoice
that I voted against his appointment,"<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> declared
Sedgwick. Cabot denounced Gerry's "course"
as "the most dangerous that cou'd have been
taken."<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> Higginson asserted that "those of us who
knew him [Gerry] regretted his appointment and
expected mischief from it; but he has conducted
himself worse than we had anticipated."<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> The
American Minister to Great Britain, bitterly humiliated,
wrote to Hamilton that Gerry's "answer to
Talleyrand's demands of the names of X, Y, and Z,
place him in a more degraded light than I ever believed
it possible that he or any other American
citizen could be exhibited."<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> And Thomas Pinckney<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
feared "that to want of [Gerry's] judgment ... may
be added qualities of a more criminal nature."<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p>Such sentiments, testifies Pickering, were common
to all "the public men whom I had heard speak of
Mr. G."; Pinckney, Gerry's colleague, tells his
brother that he "never met with a man <i>so destitute of
candour and so full of deceit as Mr. Gerry</i>," and that
this opinion was shared by Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> Troup wrote:
"We have seen and read with the greatest contempt
the correspondence between Talleyrand and Mr.
Gerry relative to Messrs. X. Y. and Z.... I can
say nothing honorable to [of] him [Gerry]. De
mortuis nil nisi bonum is a maxim as applicable to
him as if he was in his grave."<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> Washington gave
his opinion with unwonted mildness: "Nothing can
excuse his [Gerry's] <i>secret</i> negotiations....
I fear ... that <i>vanity</i> which may have led him into the
mistake&mdash;&amp; consciousness of being <i>duped</i> by the
<i>Diplomatic skill</i> of our good and magnanimous
Allies are too powerful for a weak mind to overcome."<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>Marshall was on tenter-hooks for fear that Gerry
would not leave France before the Directory got
wind "of the present temper" of the American
people, and would hint to Gerry "insidious propositions ... not
with real pacific views but for the
purpose of dividing the people of this country and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
separating them from their government."<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> The
peppery Secretary of State grew more and more
intolerant of Gerry. He tells Marshall that
"Gerry's correspondence with Talleyrand about
W.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> X. Y. and Z: ... is the finishing stroke to his
conduct in France, by which he has dishonoured
and injured his country and sealed his own indelible
disgrace."<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<p>Marshall was disgusted with the Gerry-Talleyrand
correspondence about the names of "X. Y. Z.,"
and wrote Pickering of Gerry's dinner to Talleyrand
at which Hottenguer, Bellamy, and Hauteval
were present and of their corrupt proposition to
Gerry in Talleyrand's presence.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> Pickering urged
Marshall to write "a short history of the mission
of the envoys extraordinary," and asked permission
to show Marshall's journal to President
Adams.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>

<p>Marshall is "unwilling," he says, "that my hasty
journal, which I had never even read over until I
received it from you, should be shown to him. This
unwillingness proceeds from a repugnance to give
him the vexation which I am persuaded it would give
him." Nevertheless, Adams did read Marshall's
Journal, it appears; for Cabot believed that "the
reading of Marshall's journal has compelled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
P[resident] to ... acquiesce in the unqualified condemnation
of Gerry."<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

<p>On his return to America, Gerry writes a turgid
letter defending himself and exculpating Talleyrand
and the Directory. The Secretary of State sends
Gerry's letter to Marshall, declaring that Gerry
"ought to be impeached."<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> It "astonishes me,"
replies Marshall; and while he wishes to avoid altercation,
he thinks "it is proper for me to notice this
letter," and encloses a communication to Gerry,
together with a "certificate," stating the facts of
Gerry's now notorious dinner to Talleyrand.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>Marshall is especially anxious to avoid any personal
controversy at the particular moment; for, as
will presently appear, he is again running for office.
He tells Pickering that the Virginia Republicans
are "perfectly prepared" to use Gerry in any way
"which can be applied to their purposes"; and are
ready "to receive him into their bosoms or to drop
him entirely as he may be French or American."
He is so exasperated, however, that he contemplates
publishing the whole truth about Gerry, but
adds: "I have been restrained from doing so by
my having as a punishment for some unknown sins,
consented to be nam'd a candidate for the ensuing
election to Congress."<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>Finding himself so violently attacked in the press,
Marshall says: "To protect myself from the vexation
of these newspaper altercations ... I wish if it be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
possible to avoid appearing in print myself." Also
he makes the excuse that the courts are in session,
and that "my absence has plac'd my business in
such a situation as scarcely to leave a moment
which I can command for other purposes."<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></p>

<p>A week later Marshall is very anxious as to what
course Gerry intends to take, for, writes Marshall,
publications to mollify public opinion toward
France and to irritate it against England "and to
diminish the repugnance to pay money to the
French republic are appearing every day."<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></p>

<p>The indefatigable Republican chieftain had been
busily inspiring attacks upon the conduct of the
mission and particularly upon Marshall. "You
know what a wicked use has been made of the ... X.
Y. Z. dish cooked up by Marshall, where the
swindlers are made to appear as the French government,"
wrote Jefferson to Pendleton. "Art and
industry combined have certainly wrought out of
this business a wonderful effect on the people."
But "now that Gerry comes out clearing the French
government of that turpitude, ... the people will
be disposed to suspect they have been duped."</p>

<p>Because Marshall's dispatches "are too voluminous
for them [the people] and beyond their reach"
Jefferson begs Pendleton to write a pamphlet "recapitulating
the whole story ... short, simple &amp;
levelled to every capacity." It must be "so concise
as omitting nothing material, yet may be printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
in handbills." Jefferson proposes to "print &amp; disperse
10. or 20,000 copies"<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> free of postage under
the franks of Republican Congressmen.</p>

<p>Pickering having referred scathingly to the Gerry-Talleyrand
dinner, Gerry writes the President, to
deny Marshall's account of that function. Marshall
replies in a personal letter to Gerry, which, considering
Marshall's placid and unresentful nature, is a
very whiplash of rebuke; it closes, however, with
the hope that Gerry "will think justly of this subject
and will thereby save us both the pain of an
altercation I do so wish to avoid."<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

<p>A few months later Marshall, while even more
fixed than ever in his contempt for Gerry, is mellower
in expressing it. "I am grieved rather than
surprised at Mr. Gerry's letter," he writes.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> So
ended the only incident in Marshall's life where
he ever wrote severely of any man. Although the
unfriendliness between Jefferson and himself grew
through the years into unrelenting hatred on both
sides, Marshall did not express the intensity of
his feeling. While his courage, physical and moral,
was perfect, he had no stomach for verbal encounters.
He could fight to the death with arms
or arguments; but personal warfare by tongue or
pen was beyond or beneath him. Marshall simply
could not scold or browbeat. He was incapable of
participating in a brawl.</p>

<p>Soon after reaching Richmond, the domestic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
Marshall again shines out sunnily in a letter to his
wife at Winchester, over the Blue Ridge. He tells
his "dearest Polly" that although a week has passed
he has "scarcely had time to look into any business
yet, there are so many persons calling every hour
to see me.... The hot and disagreeable ride" to
Richmond had been too much for him, but "if I
could only learn that you were entirely restored
I should be happy. Your Mama &amp; friends are in
good health &amp; your Mama is as cheerful as usual
except when some particular conversation discomposes
her.</p>

<p>"Your sweet little Mary is one of the most fascinating
little creatures I ever beheld. She has improved
very much since I saw her &amp; I cannot help
agreeing that she is a substitute for her lovely sister.
She talks in a way not easily to be understood
tho she comprehends very well everything that is
said to her &amp; is the most coquettish little prude &amp;
the most prudish little coquet I ever saw. I wish she
was with you as I think she would entertain you
more than all the rest of your children put together.</p>

<p>"Poor little John<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> is cutting teeth &amp; of course is
sick. He appeared to know me as soon as he saw me.
He would not come to me, but he kept his eyes fixed
on me as on a person he had some imperfect recollection
of. I expect he has been taught to look at the
picture &amp; had some confused idea of a likeness. He
is small &amp; weakly but by no means an ugly child.
If as I hope we have the happiness to raise him I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
trust he will do as well as the rest. Poor little fellow,
the present hot weather is hard on him cutting
teeth, but great care is taken of him &amp; I hope he will
do well.</p>

<p>"I hear nothing from you my dearest Polly but
I will cherish the hope that you are getting better &amp;
will indulge myself with expecting the happiness of
seeing you in October quite yourself. Remember my
love to give me this pleasure you have only to take
the cold bath, to use a great deal of exercise, to sleep
tranquilly &amp; to stay in cheerful company. I am sure
you will do everything which can contribute to give
you back to yourself &amp; me. This hot weather must
be very distressing to you&mdash;it is to everybody&mdash;but
it will soon be colder. Let me know in time everything
relative to your coming down. Farewell my
dearest Polly. I am your ever affectionate</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">J. Marshall</span>."<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a><br />
</p>

<p>On taking up his private business, Marshall
found himself hard-pressed for money. Payments
for the Fairfax estate were overdue and he had no
other resources with which to meet them but the
money due him upon his French mission. "The
disarrangement," he writes to the Secretary of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
State, "produc'd by my absence and the dispersion
of my family oblige me to make either sales
which I do not wish or to delay payments of money
which I ought not to delay, unless I can receive
from the treasury. This state of things obliges me
to apply to you and to ask whether you can furnish
me either with an order from the Secretary of the
Treasury on Colo. Carrington or with your request
to him to advance money to me. The one or the
other will be sufficient."<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>

<p>Pickering writes Marshall that Carrington can
safely advance him the needed cash. "I will lose no
time to place the balance in your hands,"<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> says
Pickering, upon the receipt of Marshall's statement
of his account with the Government.</p>

<p>The total amount paid Marshall for his eleven
months' absence upon the French mission was
$19,963.97,<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> which, allowing five thousand dollars
for his expenses&mdash;a generous estimate&mdash;was considerably
more than three times as much as Marshall's
annual income from his law practice. It
was an immense sum, considering the compensation
of public officials at that period&mdash;not much
less than the annual salaries of the President and his
entire Cabinet; more than the total amount annu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>ally
paid to the justices of the Supreme Court. Thus,
for the time being, the Fairfax estate was saved.</p>

<p>It was still necessary, however, if he, his brother,
and brother-in-law, were to discharge the remaining
payments, that Marshall should give himself to the
business of making money&mdash;to work much harder
than ever he had done before and than his natural
inclinations prompted. Therefore, no more of unremunerative
public life for him&mdash;no more waste
of time in the Legislature. There never could,
of course, come another such "God-send," to use
Marshall's phrase as reported by Jefferson,<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> as the
French mission; and few public offices, National or
State, yielded so much as he could make in the
practice of his profession. Thus financial necessity
and his own desire settled Marshall in the resolve,
which he believed nothing ever could shake, to give
the remainder of his days to his personal and private
business. But Fate had her own plans for
John Marshall and again overruled what he believed
to be his fixed and unalterable purpose.</p>

<h3>CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of the three envoys, the conduct of General Marshall alone has been entirely
satisfactory. (Adams.)</p>

<p>In heart and sentiment, as well as by birth and interest, I am an American.
We should make no political connection with any nation on earth. (Marshall
to constituents.)</p>

<p>Tell Marshall I love him because he felt and acted as a Republican and an
American. (Patrick Henry.)</p></div>


<p>In the congressional campaign of 1798-99, the
Federalists of the Richmond District were without
a strong candidate. The one they had put up lacked
that personal popularity which then counted for as
much in political contests as the issues involved.
Upon Marshall's return from France and his enthusiastic
reception, ending with the Richmond
demonstration, the Federalist managers pressed
Marshall to take the place of the candidate then
running, who, indeed, was anxious to withdraw in
his favor. But the returned envoy refused, urged
the Federalist then standing to continue his candidacy,
and pledged that he would do all in his
power to secure his election.</p>

<p>Finally Washington asked Marshall to come to
see him. "I received an invitation from General
Washington," writes Marshall in his account of this
important event, "to accompany his nephew ... on
a visit to Mount Vernon."<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p>When Bushrod Washington wrote that Marshall
accepted the invitation, the General was extremely
gratified. "I learnt with much pleasure ... of
General Marshall's intention to make me a visit,"
he writes his nephew. "I wish it of all things; and it
is from the ardent desire I have to see him that I
have not delayed a moment to express it.... The
crisis is most important.... The temper of the
people in this state ... is so violent and outrageous
that I wish to converse with General Marshall and
yourself on the elections which must soon come."<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>
Washington says that when his visitors arrive the
matter of the fictitious Langhorne letter will also
be taken up "and we will let General Marshall into
the whole business and advise with him thereon."<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></p>

<p>To Mount Vernon, therefore, Marshall and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
companion journeyed on horseback. For convenience
in traveling, they had put their clothing in the same
pair of saddle-bags. They arrived in a heavy rain
and were "drenched to the skin." Unlocking the
saddle-bags, the first article they took out was a black
bottle of whiskey. With great hilarity each charged
this to be the property of the other. Then came a
thick twist of tobacco, some corn bread, and finally
the worn apparel of wagoners; at some tavern on the
way their saddle-bags had become exchanged for
those of drivers. The rough clothes were grotesque
misfits; and when, clad in these, his guests presented
themselves, Washington, roaring with laughter, expressed
his sympathy for the wagoners when they,
in turn, discovered the exchange they had made
with the lawyers.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> In such fashion began the conference
that ended in John Marshall's candidacy for
Congress in the vital campaign of 1798-99.</p>

<p>This was the first time, so far as is known, that
Marshall had visited Washington at his Potomac
home. No other guest except Washington's nephew
seems to have been present at this conference, so
decisive of Marshall's future. The time was September,
1798, and the conversations were held on the
broad piazza,<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> looking out upon the river, with the
new Capitol almost within sight. There, for "four
or five days," his old commander used all his influence
to induce Marshall to become the Federalist
candidate.</p>

<p>"General Washington urged the importance of
the crisis," writes Marshall in describing the cir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>cumstance;
"every man," insisted Washington,
"who could contribute to the success of sound opinions
was required by the most sacred duty to offer
his services to the public." Marshall doubted his
"ability to do any good. I told him that I had made
large pecuniary engagements which required close
attention to my profession and which would distress
me should the emoluments derived from it be abandoned."</p>

<p>Marshall told of his promise to the Federalist candidate
who was then making his campaign for election.
Washington declared that this candidate still
would withdraw in Marshall's favor; but Marshall
remained unshaken. Finally Washington gave his
own conduct as an example. Marshall thus describes
the final appeal which his old leader made to him:
"He had withdrawn from office with a declaration
of his determination never again, under any circumstances,
to enter public life. No man could be more
sincere in making that declaration, nor could any
man feel stronger motives for adhering to it. No
man could make a stronger sacrifice than he did in
breaking a resolution, thus publicly made, and
which he had believed to be unalterable. Yet I
saw him," continues Marshall, "in opposition to his
public declaration, in opposition to his private feelings,
consenting, under a sense of duty, to surrender
the sweets of retirement, and again to enter the most
arduous and perilous station which an individual could
fill. My resolution yielded to this representation."<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a tradition that, at one point in the conference,
Marshall, becoming offended by Washington's
insistence, which, runs the story, took the form
of a peremptory and angrily expressed command,
determined to leave so early in the morning that his
host would have no opportunity to press the matter
further; but, Washington noting Marshall's irritation
and anticipating his purpose, was on the piazza
when his departing guest appeared at dawn, and
there made the final appeal which won Marshall's
reluctant consent.</p>

<p>Marshall felt that he was making a heavy personal
sacrifice; it meant to him the possible loss of the
Fairfax estate. As we have seen, he had just declined
appointment to the Supreme Bench<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> for this
very reason, and this place later was given to Bushrod
Washington, largely on Marshall's advice.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> Adams
had been reluctant to give Marshall up as one of
the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court; "General
Marshall or Bushrod Washington will succeed
Judge Wilson," wrote the President to his Secretary
of State<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> nearly three months after the first tender
of the place to Marshall in Philadelphia. Later on
the President again returned to Marshall.</p>

<p>"I still think that General Marshall ought to be
preferred," he wrote. "Of the three envoys, the
conduct of Marshall alone has been entirely satisfactory,
and ought to be marked by the most decided
approbation of the public. He has raised the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
American people in their own esteem, and, if the
influence of truth and justice, reason and argument
is not lost in Europe, he has raised the consideration
of the United States in that quarter of the world....
If Mr. Marshall should decline, I should next
think of Mr. [Bushrod] Washington."<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<p>Washington's appeal to Marshall's patriotism and
sense of duty, however, outbalanced the weighty
financial reasons which decided him against becoming
an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
Thus, against his desire, he found himself once more
in the hurly-burly of partisan politics. But this
time the fight which he was forced to lead was to
be desperate, indeed.</p>

<p>The moment Marshall announced his candidacy
he became the center of Republican attack in Virginia.
The virulence of the campaign against him
was so great that it has become a tradition; and while
scarcely any of the personal assaults, which appeared
in print, are extant, they are known to have been
ruthless, and utterly unrestrained both as to the
charges made and the language used in making
them.</p>

<p>In his scurrilous review of Adams's Administration,
which Adams properly denounced as "a Mass
of Lyes from the first page to the last,"<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> John
Wood repeats the substance of some of the attacks
which, undoubtedly, were launched against Marshall
in this bitter political conflict. "John Marshall,"
says Wood, "was an improper character in several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
respects; his principles of aristocracy were well
known. Talleyrand, when in America, knew that
this man was regarded as a royalist and not as a republican,
and that he was abhorred by most honest
characters."<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a></p>

<p>The abuse must have been very harsh and unjust;
for Marshall, who seldom gave way to resentment,
complained to Pickering with uncharacteristic temper.
"The whole malignancy of Anti-federalism," he
writes, "not only in the district, where it unfortunately
is but too abundant, but throughout the
State, has become uncommonly active and considers
itself as peculiarly interested in the re&euml;lection of the
old member [Clopton].</p>

<p>"The Jacobin presses, which abound with us and
only circulate within the State, teem with publications
of which the object is to poison still further the
public opinion and which are level'd particularly
at me. Anything written by me on the subject of
French affairs wou'd be ascrib'd to me, whether it
appear'd with or without my signature and wou'd
whet and sharpen up the sting of every abusive
scribbler who had vanity enough to think himself
a writer because he cou'd bestow personal abuse
and cou'd say things as malignant as they are ill
founded."<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>The publication of the American envoys' dispatches
from France, which had put new life into the
Federalist Party, had also armed that decaying organization
with enough strength to enact the most
imprudent measures that its infatuated leaders ever
devised. During June and July, 1798, they had
succeeded in driving through Congress the famous
Alien and Sedition Laws.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p>

<p>The Alien Act authorized the President to order
out of the country all aliens whom he thought
"dangerous" or "suspected" of any "treasonable or
secret machination against the government" on pain
of imprisonment not to exceed three years and of
being forever afterwards incapacitated from becoming
citizens of the United States. But if the alien
could prove to the satisfaction of the President that
he was not dangerous, a presidential "license" might
be granted, permitting the alien to remain in the
United States as long as the President saw fit and in
such place as he might designate. If any expelled
alien returned without permission he was to be imprisoned
as long as the President thought "the
public safety may require."</p>

<p>The Sedition Act provided penalties for the crime
of unlawful combination and conspiracy against the
Government;<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> a fine not exceeding two thousand
dollars and imprisonment not exceeding two years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
for any person who should write, print, publish, or
speak anything "false, scandalous and malicious"
against the Government, either House of Congress,
or the President "with intent to defame" the Government,
Congress, or the President, or "to bring
them or either of them into contempt or disrepute;
or to excite against them or either or any of them
the hatred of the good people of the United States,
or to stir up sedition within the United States."</p>

<p>When Jefferson first heard of this proposed stupid
legislation, he did not object to it, even in his intimate
letters to his lieutenant Madison.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> Later, however,
he became the most ferocious of its assailants.
Hamilton, on the other hand, saw the danger in the
Sedition Bill the moment a copy reached him: "There
are provisions in this bill ... highly exceptionable,"
he wrote. "I hope sincerely the thing may not be
hurried through. Let us not establish a tyranny.
Energy is a very different thing from violence."<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>
When Madison got the first inkling of the Alien Bill,
he wrote to Jefferson that it "is a monster that must
forever disgrace its parents."<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the country learned what the Alien and
Sedition Laws contained, the reaction against the
Federalist Party began. In vain did the Federalists
plead to the people, as they had urged in the debate
in Congress, that these laws were justified by events;
in vain did they point out the presence in America of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
large numbers of foreigners who were active and bitter
against the American Government; in vain did
they read to citizens the abuse published in newspapers
against the Administration and cite the fact
that the editors of these libelous sheets were aliens.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a></p>

<p>The popular heart and instinct were against these
crowning blunders of Federalism. Although the
patriotic wave started by Marshall's return and the
X. Y. Z. disclosures was still running strong, a more
powerful counter-current was rising. "Liberty of
the press," "freedom of speech," "trial by jury" at
once became the watchwords and war-cries of Republicanism.
On the hustings, in the newspapers, at
the taverns, the Alien and Sedition Laws were denounced
as unconstitutional&mdash;they were null and
void&mdash;no man, much less any State, should obey or
respect them.</p>

<p>The Alien Law, said its opponents, merged the
Judicial and the Executive Departments, which the
Constitution guaranteed should be separate and distinct;
the Sedition Act denied freedom of speech,
with which the Constitution expressly forbade Congress
to interfere; both struck at the very heart of
liberty&mdash;so went the Republican argument and
appeal.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

<p>In addition to their solid objections, the Republicans
made delirious prophecies. The Alien and Sedition
Laws were, they asserted, the beginning of mon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>archy,
the foundation of absolutism. The fervid
Jefferson indulged, to his heart's content, in these
grotesque predictions: "The alien &amp; sedition laws are
working hard," declared the great Republican. Indeed,
he thought them only "an experiment on the
American mind to see how far it will bear an avowed
violation of the constitution. If this goes down, we
shall immediately see attempted another act of Congress
declaring that the President shall continue in
office during life, reserving to another occasion the
transfer of the succession to his heirs, and the establishment
of the Senate for life.... That these things
are in contemplation, I have no doubt; nor can I be
confident of their failure, after the dupery of which our
countrymen have shewn themselves susceptible."<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></p>

<p>Washington was almost as extravagant on the
other side. When an opponent of the Alien and Sedition
Acts asked him for his opinion of them, he advised
his questioner to read the opposing arguments
"and consider to what lengths a certain description
of men in our country have already driven and seem
resolved further to drive matters" and then decide
whether these laws are not necessary, against those
"who acknowledge no allegiance to this country, and
in many instances are sent among us ... for the
express purpose of poisoning the minds of our people,&mdash;and
to sow dissensions among them, in order to
alienate their affections from the government of
their choice, thereby endeavoring to dissolve the
Union."<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>Washington thought that the ferocious Republican
attack on the Alien and Sedition Laws was but a
cunning maneuver of politicians, and this, indeed, for
the moment at least, seems to have been the case.
"The Alien and Sedition Laws are now the desiderata
of the Opposition.... But any thing else would
have done,&mdash;and something there will always be,
for them to torture; and to disturb the public mind
with their unfounded and ill favored forebodings"
was his pessimistic judgment.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a></p>

<p>He sent "to General Marshall Judge Addison's
charge to the grand juries of the county courts of the
Fifth Circuit of the State of Pennsylvania.... This
charge is on the liberty of speech and of the press and
is a justification of the sedition and alien laws. But,"
wrote Washington, "I do not believe that ... it ...
or ... any other writing will produce the least
change in the conduct of the leaders of the opposition
to the measures of the general government. They
have points to carry from which no reasoning, no
consistency of conduct, no absurdity can divert
them. If, however, such writings should produce
conviction in the mind of those who have hitherto
placed faith in their assertions, it will be a fortunate
event for this country."<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall had spoken in the same vein soon after
his arrival at Richmond. "The people ... are
pretty right as it respects France," he reports to
the Secretary of State. The Republican criticisms of
the X. Y. Z. mission "make so little impression that
I believe France will be given up and the attack
upon the government will be supported by the alien
and sedition laws. I am extremely sorry to observe
that here they are more successful and that these
two laws, especially the sedition bill, are viewed by
a great many well meaning men, as unwarranted
by the constitution.</p>

<p>"I am entirely persuaded that with many the hate
of Government of our country is implacable and that
if these bills did not exist the same clamor would be
made by them on some other account, but," truthfully
and judicially writes Marshall, "there are also
many who are guided by very different motives, and
who tho' less noisy in their complaints are seriously
uneasy on this subject."<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans pressed Marshall particularly
hard on the Alien and Sedition Laws, but he found
a way to answer. Within a few days after he had
become the Federalist candidate, an anonymous
writer, signing himself "Freeholder," published in
the Richmond newspapers an open letter to Marshall
asking him whether he was for the Constitution;
whether the welfare of America depended on a foreign
alliance; whether a closer connection with Great
Britain was desirable; whether the Administration's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
conduct toward France was wise; and, above all,
whether Marshall was "an advocate of the alien
and sedition bills or in the event of your election
will you use your influence to obtain a repeal of
these laws?"</p>

<p>In printing Marshall's answers to "Freeholder,"
the "Times and Virginia Advertiser" of Alexandria
remarked: "Mr. John Marshall has offered as a
candidate for a representative in the next Congress.
He has already begun his electioneering campaign.
The following are answers to some queries proposed
to him. Whether the queries were propounded with
a view of discovering his real sentiments, or whether
they were published by one of his friends to serve
electioneering purposes, is immaterial:&mdash;The principles
Mr. Marshall professes to possess are such as
influence the conduct of every real American."<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>A week later Marshall published his answers.
"Every citizen," says he, "has a right to know the
political sentiments of a candidate"; and besides,
the candidate wishes everybody to know his "real
principles" and not "attribute" to him "those with
which active calumny has ...  aspersed" him. In
this spirit Marshall answers that "in heart and sentiment,
as well as by birth and interest," he is "an
American; attached to the ... Constitution ... which
will preserve us if we support it firmly."</p>

<p>He is, he asserts, against any alliance, "offensive
or defensive," with Great Britain or "any closer
connection with that nation than already exists....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
No man in existence is more decidedly opposed to
such an alliance or more fully convinced of the evils
that would result from it." Marshall declares that
he is for American neutrality in foreign wars; and
cites his memorial to Talleyrand as stating his views
on this subject.</p>

<p>"The whole of my politics respecting foreign nations,
are reducible to this single position: ... Commercial
intercourse with all, but political ties with
none ... buy as cheap and sell as dear as possible ... never
connect ourselves politically with any
nation whatever."</p>

<p>He disclaims the right to speak for the Administration,
but believes it to have the same principles. If
France, while at war with Great Britain, should also
make war on America, "it would be madness and
folly" not to secure the "aid of the British fleets to
prevent our being invaded"; but, not even for that,
would he "make such a sacrifice as ... we should
make by forming a permanent political connection
with ... any nation on earth."</p>

<p>Marshall says that he believes the Administration's
policy as regards France to have been correct, and
necessary to the maintenance "of the neutrality and
independence of our country." Peace with France
was not possible "without sacrificing those great
objects," for "the primary object of France is ... dominion
over others." The French accomplish
this purpose by "immense armies on their part
and divisions among ... those whom they wish to
subdue."</p>

<p>Marshall declares that he is "not an advocate of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
the Alien and Sedition Bills," and, had he been in
Congress, "certainly would have opposed them,"
although he does not "think them fraught with all
those mischiefs ascribed to them." But he thinks
them "useless ... calculated to create unnecessary
discontents and jealousies"; and that, too, "at a
time when our very existence as a nation may depend
on our union."</p>

<p>He believes that those detested laws "would never
have been enacted" if they had been opposed on
these principles by a man not suspected of intending
to destroy the government or being hostile to it."
The effort to repeal them "will be made before he
can become a member of Congress"; if it fails and
is renewed after he takes his seat, he "will obey the
voice of his constituents." He thinks, however, it
will be unwise to revive the Alien and Sedition Acts
which are, by their own terms, about to expire; and
Marshall pledges that he will "indisputably oppose
their revival."<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p>Upon Marshall as their favorite candidate for
Congress, the eyes of the Federalist leaders in other
States were focused. They were particularly anxious
and uncertain as to his stand on the Alien and Sedition
Laws; for he seems to have privately expressed,
while in Philadelphia on his return from France, a
mild disapproval of the wisdom and political expe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>diency
of this absurd legislation. His answers to
"Freeholder" were therefore published everywhere.
When the New England Federalists read them in
the "Columbian Centinel" of Saturday, October
20, most of them were as hot against Marshall as
were the rabid Virginia Republicans.</p>

<p>Ames whetted his rhetoric to razor edge and
slashed without mercy. He describes Republican
dismay when Marshall's dispatches were published:
"The wretches [Republicans] looked round, like
Milton's devils when first recovering from the
stunning force of their fall from Heaven, to see
what new ground they could take." They chose,
says Ames, "the alien and sedition bills, and the
land tax" with which to arouse discontent and revive
their party. So "the implacable foes of the
Constitution&mdash;foes before it was made, while it was
making, and since&mdash;became full of tender fears
lest it should be violated by the alien and sedition
laws."</p>

<p>The Federalists, complained Ames, "are forever
hazarding the cause by heedless and rash concessions.
John Marshall, with all his honors in blossom
and bearing fruit, answers some newspaper queries
unfavorably to these laws.... No correct man,&mdash;no
incorrect man, even,&mdash;whose affections and
feelings are wedded to the government, would give
his name to the base opposers of the law.... This
he has done. Excuses may palliate,&mdash;future zeal in
the cause may partially atone,&mdash;but his character
is done for.... Like a man who in battle receives
an ounce ball in his body&mdash;it may heal, it lies too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
deep to be extracted.... There let it lie. False
Federalists, or such as act wrong from false fears,
should be dealt hardly by, if I were Jupiter Tonans....
The moderates [like Marshall] are the meanest
of cowards, the falsest of hypocrites."<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> Theodore
Sedgwick declared that Marshall's "mysterious &amp;
unpardonable" conduct had aided "french villainy"
and that he had "degraded himself by a mean &amp;
paltry electioneering trick."<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></p>

<p>At first, the Republicans praised Marshall's
stand; and this made the New England Federalists
frantic. Cabot, alone, defended Marshall in the
press, although not over his own name and only as
a matter of party tactics. He procured some one
to write to the "Columbian Centinel" under the
name of "A Yankee Freeholder." This contributor
tried to explain away Marshall's offense.</p>

<p>"General Marshall is a citizen too eminent for his
talents, his virtues and his public services, to merit
so severe a punishment as to [receive the] applause
of disorganizers [Republicans]." He should be saved
from the "admiration of the <i>seditious</i>"&mdash;that
much was due to Marshall's "spirit, firmness and
eloquence" in the contest with "the Despots of
<i>France</i>." As "drowning men would catch at straws"
so "the eagle-eyed and disheartened sons of faction"
had "with forlorn and desperate ... avidity ... seized
on" Marshall's answers to "Freeholder."</p>

<p>And no wonder; for "even <i>good men</i> have stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
appalled, at observing a man whom they so highly
venerate soliciting votes at the expense of principles
which they deem sacred and inviolable." "Yankee
Freeholder" therefore proposes "to vindicate
General <span class="smcap">Marshall</span>."</p>

<p>Marshall was the only Richmond Federalist who
could be elected; he "patriotically" had consented
to run only because of "the situation and danger of
his country at this moment." Therefore "it was
absolutely necessary to take all the ordinary steps"
to succeed. This "may appear extraordinary ... to
those who are only acquainted with the delicacy of
<i>New England</i> elections where <i>personal</i> solicitation
is the Death-warrant to success"; but it was "not
only pardonable but necessary ... in the Southern
States."</p>

<p>"Yankee Freeholder" reminded his readers that
"Calumny had assailed General <span class="smcap">Marshall</span>, in
common with other men of merit." Virginia newspapers
had "slandered him"; politicians had called
him "<i>Aristocrat</i>, <i>Tory</i>, and <i>British Agent</i>. All this
abuse ... would infallibly have rendered him popular
in <i>New-England</i>"&mdash;but not so in "<i>Virginia</i>,"
where there were "too many ignorant, ill-informed
and inflamed minds."</p>

<p>Therefore, "it became necessary that General
<span class="smcap">Marshall</span> should explicitly exhibit his political
creed." After all, his answers to "Freeholder" were
not so bad&mdash;he did not assail the constitutionality
of the Alien and Sedition Laws. "If Gen. <span class="smcap">Marshall</span>
thought them unconstitutional or dangerous to liberty,
would he" be content merely to say they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
unnecessary? "Would a man of General <span class="smcap">Marshall's</span>
force of reasoning, simply denominate <i>laws
useless</i>," if he thought them unconstitutional? "No&mdash;the
idea is too absurd to be indulged.... Time
and General <span class="smcap">Marshall's</span> conduct will hereafter
prove that I am not mistaken in my opinion of his
sentiments."<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></p>

<p>Cabot's strategy had little effect on New England,
which appeared to dislike Virginia with a curious
intolerance. The Essex County politician, nevertheless,
stood by his guns; and six months later thus
reassures King: "I am ready to join you as well as
Ames in reprobating the publication of Marshall's
sentiments on the Sedition &amp; Alien Acts, but I still
<i>adhere</i> to my first opinion that Marshall ought not
to be attacked in the Newspapers, nor too severely
condemned anywhere, because Marshall has not yet
learned his whole lesson, but has a mind &amp; disposition
which can hardly fail to make him presently an
accomplished (political) Scholar &amp; a very useful
man.</p>

<p>"Some allowance too should be made," contends
Cabot, "for the influence of the Atmosphere of
Virginia which doubtless makes every one who
breathes it visionary &amp;, upon the subject of Free
Govt., incredibly credulous; but it is certain that
Marshall at Phila. would become a most powerful
auxiliary to the cause of order &amp; good Govt., &amp;
<i>therefore</i> we ought not to diminish his fame which
wou'd ultimately be a loss to ourselves."<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p>The experienced practical politician, Sedgwick,
correctly judged that "Freeholder's" questions to
Marshall and Marshall's answers were an "electioneering
trick." But Pickering stoutly defended Marshall
upon this charge. "I have not met with one
good federalist, who does not regret his answers to
the Freeholder; but I am sorry that it should be
imagined to be an 'electioneering trick.'... General
Marshall is incapable of doing a dishonorable
act." Only Marshall's patriotism had induced him
to accept the French mission, said the Secretary of
State.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> Nothing but "the urging of friends ... overcame
his reluctance to come to Congress....
A man of untainted honor," had informed Pickering
that "Marshall is a <i>Sterling fellow</i>."<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>

<p>The Federalists' complaints of him continued to
be so strong and widespread, however, that they
even reached our legations in Europe: "I too have
lamented that John Marshall, after such a mission
particularly, should lend himself thus against a law
which the French Jacobinism in the United States
had forced government to adopt. M[arshall] <i>before</i>,
was not, that we ever heard of, one of us."<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a></p>

<p>Toward the end of October Marshall gives his
private opinion of the Virginia Republicans and
their real motives, and foretells the Virginia Resolutions.
"The real french party of this country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
again begins to show itself," he writes. "There are
very many indeed in this part of Virginia who speak
of our own government as an enemy infinitely more
formidable and infinitely more to be guarded against
than the French Directory. Immense efforts are
made to induce the legislature of the state which will
meet in Dec'r to take some violent measure which
may be attended with serious consequences. I am
not sure that these efforts will entirely fail. It requires
to be in this part of Virginia to know the degree
of irritation which has been excited and the
probable extent of the views of those who excite it."<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a></p>

<p>The most decent of the attacks on Marshall were
contained in a series of open letters first published
in the "Aurora"<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> and signed "Curtius."</p>

<p>"You have long been regarded," writes Curtius,
"as the leader of that party in this State" which has
tried "by audacious efforts to erect a monarchy or
aristocracy upon the ruins of our free constitution.
The energy of your mind and the violence of your
zeal have exalted you to this bad eminence." If
you had "employed your talents in defense of the
people ... your history would have been read in a
nation's eyes."</p>

<p>"The publication of your dispatches and the
happy exercise of diplomatic skill has produced a
momentary delusion and infatuation in which an
opposition to the administration is confounded with
hostility to the government and treason to the country....
The execrations and yells against French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
cruelty and French ambition, are incessantly kept
up by the hirelings of Great Britain and the enemies
of liberty."</p>

<p>But, he cries, "the vengeance of an oppressed
and insulted people is almost as terrible as the
wrath of Heaven"; and, like a true partisan, Curtius
predicts that this is about to fall on Marshall.
Why, he asks, is Marshall so vague on the constitutionality
of the Alien and Sedition Laws?<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>
"Notwithstanding the magnitude ... of your talents,
you are ridiculously awkward in the arts of
dissimulation and hypocrisy.... It is painful to
attack ... a man whose talents are splendid and
whose private character is amiable"; but "sacred
duties ... to the cause of truth and liberty require
it." Alas for Marshall! "You have lost forever,"
Curtius assures him, "the affection of a nation and
the applause of a world. In vain will you pursue
the thorny and rugged path that leads to fame."<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a></p>

<p>But while "monarchist," "aristocrat," "British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
agent," "enemy of free speech," "destroyer of trial
by jury" were among the more moderate epithets
that filled the air from Republican lips; and "anarchist,"
"Frenchman," "traitor," "foe of law and
order," "hater of government" were the milder of
the counter-blasts from the Federalists, all this was
too general, scattered, and ineffective to suit the
leader of the Republican Party. Jefferson saw that
the growing popular rage against the Alien and
Sedition Laws must be gathered into one or two
concentrated thunderbolts and thus hurled at the
heads of the already quaking Federalists.</p>

<p>How to do it was the question to which Jefferson
searched for an answer. It came from the bravest,
most consistent, most unselfish, as well as one of the
very ablest of Republicans, John Taylor "of Caroline,"
Virginia. In a letter to Jefferson concerning the
Alien and Sedition Laws, this eminent and disinterested
radical suggested that "<i>the right of the State
governments to expound the constitution</i> might possibly
be made the basis of a movement towards its amendment.
If this is insufficient the people in state conventions
are incontrovertibly the contracting parties
and, possessing the infringing rights, may proceed
by orderly steps to attain the object."<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a></p>

<p>So was planted in Jefferson's mind the philosophy
of secession. In that fertile and receptive soil it grew
with magic rapidity and bore fatal fruit. Within two
months after he received Taylor's letter, Jefferson
wrote the historic resolutions which produced a situ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>ation
that, a few years afterward, called forth Marshall's
first great constitutional opinion, and, not
many decades later, gave the battle-cry that rallied
heroic thousands to armed resistance to the National
Government.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> On October 5, 1798, Nicholas writes
Jefferson that he has delivered to "Mr. John Breckenridge
a copy of the resolutions that you sent me."<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>
They were passed by the Legislature of Kentucky
on November 14, 1798; and the tremendous conflict
between Nationality and States' Rights, which for
so long had been preparing, at last was formally begun.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>
Jefferson's "Kentucky Resolutions" declared
that parts of the Alien and Sedition Laws were
"altogether void and of no effect."<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> Thus a State<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
asserted the "right" of any or all States to annul
and overthrow a National law.</p>

<p>As soon as Kentucky had acted, Jefferson thus
writes Madison: "I enclose you a copy of the
draught of the Kentucky resolves. I think we
should distinctly affirm all the important principles
they contain so as to hold that ground in future, and
leave the matter in such a train as that we may not
be committed absolutely to push the matter to extremities,
&amp; yet may be free to push as far as events
will render prudent."<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a></p>

<p>Madison accordingly drew the resolutions adopted
by the Legislature of Virginia, December 21, 1798.
While declaring the Alien and Sedition Laws unconstitutional,
the Virginia Resolutions merely appealed
to the other States to "co-operate with this state in
maintaining unimpaired the authority, rights, and
liberties reserved to the states respectively or to the
people."<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></p>

<p>The Legislature promptly adopted them and
would gladly have approved far stronger ones. "The
leaders ... were determined upon the overthrow of
the General Government; and if no other measure

from the Union,'"<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> Iredell writes his wife:
"The General Assembly of Virginia are pursuing

as existed in the V[irginia] Assembly."<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

<p>Following their defiant adoption of Madison's
resolutions, the Republican majority of the Legislature
issued a campaign pamphlet, also written by
Madison,<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> under the form of an address to the people.
The "guardians of State Sovereignty would be
perfidious if they did not warn" the people "of
encroachments which ... may" result in "usurped
power"; the State Governments would be "precipitated
into impotency and contempt" in case they
yielded to such National laws as the Alien and Sedition
Acts; if like "infractions of the Federal Compact"
were repeated "until the people arose ... in
the majesty of their strength," it was certain that
"the way for a revolution would be prepared."</p>

<p>The Federalist pleas "to disregard usurpation
until foreign danger shall have passed" was "an artifice
which may be forever used," because those who
wished National power extended "can ever create
national embarrassments to soothe the people to
sleep whilst that power is swelling, silently, secretly
and fatally."</p>

<p>Such was the Sedition Act which "commits the
sacrilege of arresting reason; ... punishes without
trial; ... bestows on the President despotic powers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span> ... which
was never expected by the early friends of
the Constitution." But now "Federal authority is
deduced by implication" by which "the states will
be stript of every right reserved." Such "tremendous
pretensions ... inflict a death wound on the
Sovereignty of the States." Thus wrote the same
Madison who had declared that nothing short of a
veto by the National Government on "any and
every act of the states" would suffice. There was,
said Madison's campaign document, no "specified
power" in the National Government "embracing a
right against freedom of the press"&mdash;that was a
"constitutional" prerogative of the States.</p>

<p>"Calumny" could be redressed in the State courts;
but "usurpation can only be controuled by the act
of society [revolution]." Here Madison quotes <i>verbatim</i>
and in italics from Marshall's second letter to
Talleyrand in defense of the liberty of the press,
without, however, giving Marshall credit for the
language or argument.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> Madison's argument is characteristically
clear and compact, but abounds in
striking phrases that suggest Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>This "Address" of the Virginia Legislature was
aimed primarily at Marshall, who was by far the
most important Federalist candidate for Congress
in the entire State. It was circulated at public expense
and Marshall's friends could not possibly get
his views before the people so authoritatively or so
widely. But they did their best, for it was plain that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
Madison's Jeffersonized appeal, so uncharacteristic
of that former Nationalist, must be answered. Marshall
wrote the reply<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> of the minority of the Legislature,
who could not "remain silent under the unprecedented"
attack of Madison. "Reluctantly,"
then, they "presented the present crisis plainly
before" the people.</p>

<p>"For ... national independence ... the people
of united America" changed a government by the
British King for that of the Constitution. "The will
of the majority produced, ratified, and conducts"
this constitutional government. It was not perfect,
of course; but "the best rule for freemen ... in the
opinion of our ancestors, was ... that ... of obedience
to laws enacted by a majority of" the people's
representatives.</p>

<p>Two other principles "promised immortality" to
this fundamental idea: power of amendment and
frequency of elections. "Under a Constitution thus
formed, the prosperity of America" had become
"great and unexampled." The people "bemoaned
foreign war" when it "broke out"; but "they did
not possess even a remote influence in its termination."
The true American policy, therefore, was in
the "avoiding of the existing carnage and the continuance
of our existing happiness." It was for this
reason that Washington, after considering everything,
had proclaimed American Neutrality. Yet
Gen&ecirc;t had "appealed" to the people "with acrimony"
against the Government. This was resented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
"for a while only" and "the fire was rekindled as
occasion afforded fuel."</p>

<p>Also, Great Britain's "unjustifiable conduct ... rekindled
our ardor for hostility and revenge." But
Washington, averse to war, "made his last effort to
avert its miseries." So came the Jay Treaty by
which "peace was preserved with honor."</p>

<p>Marshall then reviews the outbursts against the
Jay Treaty and their subsidence. France "taught by
the bickerings of ourselves ... re&euml;choed American
reproaches with French views and French objects";
as a result "our commerce became a prey to French
cruisers; our citizens were captured" and British
outrages were repeated by the French, our "former
friend ... thereby committing suicide on our national
and individual happiness."</p>

<p>Emulating Washington, Adams had twice striven
for "honorable" adjustment. This was met by "an
increase of insolence and affront." Thus America
had "to choose between submission ... and ... independence.
What American," asks Marshall, "could
hesitate in the option?" And, "the choice being
made, self-preservation commanded preparations
for self-defense....&mdash;the fleet, ... an army, a
provision for the removal of dangerous aliens and the
punishment of seditious citizens." Yet such measures
"are charged with the atrocious design of creating
a monarchy ... and violating the constitution."
Marshall argues that military preparation is
our only security.</p>

<p>"Upon so solemn an occasion what curses would
be adequate," asks Marshall, "to the supineness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
our government, if militia were the only resort for
safety, against the invasion of a veteran army,
flushed with repeated victories, strong in the skill of
its officers, and led by distinguished officers?" He
then continues with the familiar arguments for military
equipment.</p>

<p>Then comes his attack on the Virginia Resolutions.
Had the criticisms of the Alien and Sedition
Laws "been confined to ordinary peaceable and constitutional
efforts to repeal them," no objection
would have been made to such a course; but when
"general hostility to our government" and "proceedings
which may sap the foundations of our
union" are resorted to, "duty" requires this appeal
to the people.</p>

<p>Marshall next defends the constitutionality of
these acts. "Powers necessary for the attainment of
all objects which are general in their nature, which
interest all America" and "can only be obtained by
the co&ouml;peration of the whole ... would be naturally
vested in the government of the whole." It is obvious,
he argues, that States must attend to local
subjects and the Nation to general affairs.</p>

<p>The power to protect "the nation from the intrigues
and conspiracies of dangerous aliens; ... to
secure the union from their wicked machinations, ... which
is essential to the common good," belongs to
the National Government in the hands of which "is
the force of the nation and the general power of protection
from hostilities of every kind." Marshall
then makes an extended argument in support of
his Nationalist theory. Occasionally he employs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
almost the exact language which, years afterwards,
appears in those constitutional opinions from the
Supreme Bench that have given him his lasting fame.
The doctrine of implied powers is expounded with all
of his peculiar force and clearness, but with some
overabundance of verbiage. In no writing or spoken
word, before he became Chief Justice of the United
States, did Marshall so extensively state his constitutional
views as in this unknown paper.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></p>

<p>The House of Delegates, by a vote of 92 against
52,<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> refused to publish the address of the minority
along with that of the majority. Thereupon the Federalists
printed and circulated it as a campaign document.
It was so admired by the supporters of the
Administration in Philadelphia that, according to
the untrustworthy Callender, ten thousand copies
were printed in the Capital and widely distributed.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's authorship of this paper was not popularly
known; and it produced little effect. Its tedious
length, lighted only by occasional flashes of eloquence,
invited Republican ridicule and derision. It
contained, said Callender, "such quantities of words ... that you turn absolutely tired"; it abounded in
"barren tautology"; some sentences were nothing
more than mere "assemblages of syllables"; and
"the hypocritical canting that so strongly marks it
corresponds very well with the dispatches of X. Y.
and Z."<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's careful but over-elaborate paper was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
not, therefore, generally read. But the leading Federalists
throughout the country were greatly pleased.
The address was, said Sedgwick, "a masterly performance
for which we are indebted to the pen of
General Marshall, who has, by it, in some measure
atoned for his pitiful electioneering epistle."<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

<p>When Murray, at The Hague, read the address, he
concluded that Marshall was its author: "He may
have been weak enough to declare <i>against</i> those laws
that <i>might</i> be against the <i>policy</i> or necessity, etc.,
etc., etc., yet sustain their constitutionality.... I
<i>hope</i> J. Marshall did write the Address."<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

<p>The Republican appeal, unlike that of Marshall,
was brief, simple, and replete with glowing catchwords
that warmed the popular heart and fell easily
from the lips of the multitude. And the Republican
spirit was running high. The Virginia Legislature
provided for an armory in Richmond to resist
"encroachments" of the National Government.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>
Memorials poured into the National Capital.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> By
February "the tables of congress were loaded with
petitions against" the unpopular Federalist legislation.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's opinion of the motives of the Republican
leaders, of the uncertainty of the campaign, of
the real purpose of the Virginia Resolutions, is
frankly set forth in his letter to Washington acknowl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>edging
the receipt of Judge Addison's charge: "No
argument," wrote Marshall, "can moderate the
leaders of the opposition.... However I may regret
the passage of one of the acts complained of [Sedition
Law] I am firmly persuaded that the tempest has not
been raised by them. Its cause lies much deeper and
is not easily to be removed. Had they [Alien and
Sedition Laws] never been passed, other measures
would have been selected. An act operating on the
press in any manner, affords to its opposers arguments
which so captivate the public ear, which so
mislead the public mind that the efforts of reason"
are unavailing.</p>

<p>Marshall tells Washington that "the debates were
long and animated" upon the Virginia Resolutions
"which were substantiated by a majority of twenty-nine."
He says that "sentiments were declared and ... views
were developed of a very serious and
alarming extent.... There are men who will hold
power by any means rather than not hold it; and who
would prefer a dissolution of the union to a continuance
of an administration not of their own party.
They will risk all ills ... rather than permit that
happiness which is dispensed by other hands than
their own."</p>

<p>He is not sure, he says, of being elected; but adds,
perhaps sarcastically, that "whatever the issue ... may
be I shall neither reproach myself, nor those
at whose instance I have become a candidate, for
the step I have taken. The exertions against me by"
men in Virginia "and even from other states" are
more "active and malignant than personal consid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>erations
would excite. If I fail," concludes Marshall,
"I shall regret the failure more" because it will show
"a temper hostile to our government ... than of"
his own "personal mortification."<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

<p>The Federalists were convinced that these extreme
Republican tactics were the beginning of a serious
effort to destroy the National Government. "The
late attempt of Virginia and Kentucky," wrote
Hamilton, "to unite the State Legislatures in a direct
resistance to certain laws of the Union can be
considered in no other light than as an attempt to
change the government"; and he notes the "hostile
declarations" of the Virginia Legislature; its "actual
preparation of the means of supporting them by
force"; its "measures to put their militia on a
more efficient footing"; its "preparing considerable
arsenals and magazines"; and its "laying new taxes
on its citizens" for these purposes.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a></p>

<p>To Sedgwick, Hamilton wrote of the "tendency of
the doctrine advanced by Virginia and Kentucky to
destroy the Constitution of the United States," and
urged that the whole subject be referred to a special
committee of Congress which should deal with the
Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions and justify the
laws at which they were aimed. "No pains or expense,"
he insisted, "should be spared to disseminate
this report.... A little pamphlet containing it
should find its way into every house in Virginia."<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the congressional campaign of 1798-99
drew to a close. Marshall neglected none of those
personal and familiar campaign devices which the
American electorate of that time loved so well. His
enemies declared that he carried these to the extreme;
at a rally in Hanover County he "threw
billets into the bonfires and danced around them
with his constituents";<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> he assured the voters that
"his sentiments were the same as those of Mr. Clopton
[the Republican candidate]"; he "spent several
thousands of dollars upon barbecues."<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<p>These charges of the besotted Callender,<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> written
from his cell in the jail at Richmond, are, of course,
entirely untrue, except the story of dancing about
the bonfire. Marshall's answers to "Freeholder" dispose
of the second; his pressing need of money for
the Fairfax purchase shows that he could have afforded
no money for campaign purposes; and, indeed,
this charge was so preposterous that even the reckless
Callender concludes it to be unworthy of belief.</p>

<p>From the desperate nature of the struggle and the
temper and political habit of the times, one might
expect far harder things to have been said. Indeed,
as the violence of the contest mounted to its climax,
worse things were charged or intimated by word of
mouth than were then put into type. Again it is the
political hack, John Wood, who gives us a hint of
the baseness of the slanders that were circulated; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
describes a scandal in which Marshall and Pinckney
were alleged to have been involved while in
Paris, the unhappy fate of a woman, her desperate
voyage to America, her persecution and sad ending.<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a></p>

<p>Marshall was profoundly disgusted by the methods
employed to defeat him. Writing to his brother
a short time before election day he briefly refers to
the Republican assaults in stronger language than
is to be found in any other letter ever written by
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The fate of my election is extremely uncertain.
The means us'd to defeat it are despicable in the
extreme and yet they succeed. Nothing I believe
more debases or pollutes the human mind than
faction [party]."<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Republicans everywhere grew more confident
as the day of voting drew near. Neutrality, the
Alien and Sedition Laws, the expense of the provisional
army, the popular fear and hatred of a permanent
military force, the high taxes, together with the
reckless charges and slanders against the Federalists
and the perfect discipline exacted of the Republicans
by Jefferson&mdash;all were rapidly overcoming the patriotic
fervor aroused by the X. Y. Z. disclosures.
"The tide is evidently turning ... from Marshall's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>romance" was the Republican commander's conclusion
as the end of the campaign approached.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a></p>

<p>For the first time Marshall's personal popularity
was insufficient to assure victory. But the animosity
of the Republicans caused them to make a false
move which saved him at the very last. They circulated
the report that Patrick Henry, the archenemy
of "aristocrats," was against Marshall because
the latter was one of this abhorred class.
Marshall's friend, Archibald Blair, Clerk of the
Executive Council, wrote Henry of this Republican
campaign story.</p>

<p>Instantly both the fighter and the politician in
Henry were roused; and the old warrior, from his
retirement at Red Hill, wrote an extraordinary
letter, full of affection for Marshall and burning
with indignation at the Republican leaders. The
Virginia Resolutions meant the "dissolution" of the
Nation, wrote Henry; if that was not the purpose of
the Republicans "they have none and act <i>ex tempore</i>."
As to France, "her conduct has made it to
the interest of the great family of mankind to wish
the downfall of her present government." For the
French Republic threatened to "destroy the great
pillars of all government and social life&mdash;I mean
virtue, morality, and religion," which "alone ... is
the armour ... that renders us invincible." Also,
said Henry, "infidelity, in its broad sense, under
the name of philosophy, is fast spreading ... under
the patronage of French manners and principles."</p>

<p>Henry makes "these prefatory remarks" to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
"point out the kind of character amongst our
countrymen most estimable in my [his] eyes." The
ground thus prepared, Henry discharges all his
guns against Marshall's enemies. "General Marshall
and his colleagues exhibited the American character
as respectable. France, in the period of her
most triumphant fortune, beheld them as unappalled.
Her threats left them as she found them....</p>

<p>"Can it be thought that with these sentiments I
should utter anything tending to prejudice General
Marshall's election? Very far from it indeed. Independently
of the high gratification I felt from his
public ministry, he ever stood high in my esteem as
a private citizen. His temper and disposition were
always pleasant, his talents and integrity unquestioned.</p>

<p>"These things are sufficient to place that gentleman
far above any competitor in the district for
congress. But when you add the particular information
and insight which he has gained, and is able to
communicate to our public councils, it is really
astonishing, that even blindness itself should hesitate
in the choice....</p>

<p>"Tell Marshall I love him, because he felt and
acted as a republican, as an American. The story of
the Scotch merchants and old torys voting for him
is too stale, childish, and foolish, and is a French
<i>finesse;</i> an appeal to prejudice, not reason and good
sense.... I really should give him my vote for
Congress, preferably to any citizen in the state at
this juncture, one only excepted [Washington]."<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry's letter saved Marshall. Not only was the
congressional district full of Henry's political followers,
but it contained large numbers of his close
personal friends. His letter was passed from hand to
hand among these and, by election day, was almost
worn out by constant use.<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p>But the Federalist newspapers gave Henry no
credit for turning the tide; according to these partisan
sheets it was the "anarchistic" action of the
Kentucky and Virginia Legislatures that elected
Marshall. Quoting from a letter of Bushrod Washington,
who had no more political acumen than a
turtle, a Federalist newspaper declared: "We hear
that General Marshall's election is placed beyond
all doubt. I was firmly convinced that the violent
measures of our Legislature (which were certainly
intended to influence the election) would favor the
pretensions of the Federal candidates by disclosing
the views of the opposite party."<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a></p>

<p>Late in April the election was held. A witness of
that event in Richmond tells of the incidents of the
voting which were stirring even for that period of
turbulent politics. A long, broad table or bench was
placed on the Court-House Green, and upon it the
local magistrates, acting as election judges, took their
seats, their clerks before them. By the side of the
judges sat the two candidates for Congress; and
when an elector declared his preference for either,
the favored one rose, bowing, and thanked his
supporter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody but freeholders could then exercise the
suffrage in Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> Any one owning one hundred
acres of land or more in any county could vote, and
this landowner could declare his choice in every
county in which he possessed the necessary real
estate. The voter did not cast a printed or written
ballot, but merely stated, in the presence of the two
candidates, the election officials, and the assembled
gathering, the name of the candidate of his preference.
There was no specified form for this announcement.<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a></p>

<p>"I vote for John Marshall."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said the lank, easy-mannered
Federalist candidate.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Marshall!" shouted the compact
band of Federalists.</p>

<p>"And I vote for Clopton," cried another freeholder.</p>

<p>"May you live a thousand years, my friend,"
said Marshall's competitor.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Clopton!" roared the crowd
of Republican enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Both Republican and Federalist leaders had seen
to it that nothing was left undone which might bring
victory to their respective candidates. The two
political parties had been carefully "drilled to move
together in a body." Each party had a business
committee which attended to every practical detail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
of the election. Not a voter was overlooked. "Sick
men were taken in their beds to the polls; the halt,
the lame, and the blind were hunted up and every
mode of conveyance was mustered into service."
Time and again the vote was a tie. No sooner did
one freeholder announce his preference for Marshall
than another gave his suffrage to Clopton.</p>

<p>"A barrel of whisky with the head knocked in,"
free for everybody, stood beneath a tree; and "the
majority took it straight," runs a narrative of a witness
of the scene. So hot became the contest that
fist-fights were frequent. During the afternoon,
knock-down and drag-out affrays became so general
that the county justices had hard work to quell the
raging partisans. Throughout the day the shouting
and huzzaing rose in volume as the whiskey sank
in the barrel. At times the uproar was "perfectly
deafening; men were shaking fists at each other,
rolling up their sleeves, cursing and swearing....
Some became wild with agitation." When a tie was
broken by a new voter shouting that he was for
Marshall or for Clopton, insults were hurled at his
devoted head.</p>

<p>"You, sir, ought to have your mouth smashed,"
cried an enraged Republican when Thomas Rutherford
voted for Marshall; and smashing of mouths,
blacking of eyes, and breaking of heads there were
in plenty. "The crowd rolled to and fro like a surging
wave."<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> Never before and seldom, if ever,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
since, in the history of Virginia, was any election so
fiercely contested. When this "democratic" struggle
was over, it was found that Marshall had been
elected by the slender majority of 108.<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a></p>

<p>Washington was overjoyed at the Federalist success.
He had ridden ten miles to vote for General
Lee, who was elected;<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> but he took a special delight
in Marshall's victory. He hastened to write his political
prot&eacute;g&eacute;: "With infinite pleasure I received the
news of your Election. For the honor of the District
I wish the majority had been greater; but let us be
content, and hope, as the tide is turning, the current
will soon run strong in your favor."<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a></p>

<p>Toward the end of the campaign, for the purpose
of throwing into the contest Washington's personal
influence, Marshall's enthusiastic friends had published
the fact of Marshall's refusal to accept the
various offices which had been tendered him by
Washington. They had drawn a long bow, though
very slightly, and stated positively that Marshall
could have been Secretary of State.<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> Marshall hastened
to apologize:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Few of the unpleasant occurrences" of the campaign
"have given me more real chagrin than this.
To make a parade of proffered offices is a vanity
which I trust I do not possess; but to boast of one
never in my power would argue a littleness of mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
at which I ought to blush." Marshall tells Washington
that the person who published the report "never
received it directly or indirectly from me." If he
had known "that such a publication was designed"
he "would certainly have suppressed it." It was
inspired "unquestionably ... by a wish to serve
me," says Marshall, "and by resentment at the
various malignant calumnies which have been so
profusely bestowed on me."<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a></p>

<p>Washington quickly reassured Marshall: "I am
sorry to find that the publication you allude to
should have given you a moment's disquietude. I
can assure you it made no impression on my mind,
of the tendency apprehended by you."<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a></p>

<p>As soon as all the election returns were in, Marshall
reported to Washington that the defeat of two
of the Federalist candidates for Congress was unexpected
and "has reduced us to eight in the legislature
of the Union"; that the Republicans maintained
their "majority in the house of Delegates,"
which "means an antifederal senator and governor,"
and that "the baneful influence of a legislature
hostile perhaps to the Union&mdash;or if not so&mdash;to all
its measures will be kept up."<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's campaign attracted the attention of
the whole country, and the news of his success deeply
interested both Federalists and Republicans. Pickering,
after writing King of the Federalist success
in New York City, declared that "the other domestic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
intelligence, still more important, is, that Genl.
Marshall is elected a member of Congress for his
district."<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a></p>

<p>Speaker Sedgwick also informed King of Marshall's
election. "General Marshall you know is a
member of the House of Representatives. His talents,
his character and the situation he has been in,
will combine to give him an influence, which will be
further aided by the scene which he immediately
represents. He may and probably will give a tone to
the federal politics South of the Susquehannah.
I well know the respect he entertains for you and
for your opinions."<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a></p>

<p>But the Federalist leaders were none too sure of
their Virginia congressional recruit. He was entirely
too independent to suit the party organization.
His campaign statement on the Alien and
Sedition Laws angered and troubled them when it
was made; and, now that Marshall was elected, his
opinion on this, to the Federalists, vital subject,
his admitted power of mind and character, and his
weighty influence over the Southern wing of the
Federalists caused serious apprehension among the
party's Northern leaders. Sedgwick advises King
to write Marshall on the subject of party regularity.</p>

<p>"I have brought this subject to your mind, that
you may decide on the propriety of a communication
of your sentiments to him, which you may do in
season to be useful. Should he, which, indeed, I do
not expect, conform his political conduct generally, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
what seems indicated by his public declaration relative
to the alien &amp; sedition acts, it would have been
better that his insignificant predecessor should have
been re&euml;lected. There never has been an instance
where the commencement of a political career was
so important as is that of General Marshall."<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

<p>Apprehension and uncertainty as to Marshall's
course in the House was in the minds of even the
Federalist leaders who were out of the country. The
American Minister at The Hague was as much
troubled about Marshall as were the Federalist
politicians at home: "If M[arshall]'s silly declaration
on the <i>inexpediency</i> of the Sedition law does not
entangle him he may be very useful."<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> But Murray
was uneasy: "Marshall, I fear, comes in on
middle ground, and when a man plays the amiable
in a body like that [House of Representatives] he
cannot be counted [on], but he will vote generally
right. I was amiable the first session! It cannot
last."<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson, of course, was much depressed by the
Federalist congressional victories, which he felt
"are extremely to be regretted." He was especially
irritated by Marshall's election: It "marks a taint
in that part of the State which I had not expected."
He was venomous toward Henry for having helped
Marshall: "His [Henry's] apostacy, must be unaccountable
to those who do not know all the recesses
of his heart."<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>A week later, however, Jefferson decided that the
Federalist success did not mean a permanent Republican
reverse. Spoils and corruption, he concluded,
were the real cause of the Federalist gain.
"The Virginia congressional elections have astonished
every one," he informs Tench Coxe. "This
result has proceeded from accidental combinations
of circumstances, &amp; not from an unfavorable change
of sentiment.... We are not incorruptible; on the
contrary, corruption is making sensible tho' silent
progress. Offices are as acceptable here as elsewhere,
&amp; whenever a man has cast a longing on them, a
rottenness begins in his conduct."<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson, with settled and burning hatred, now
puts his branding-iron on Henry: "As to the effect
of his name among the people, I have found it crumble
like a dried leaf the moment they become satisfied
of his apostacy."<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a></p>

<p>During the weeks which immediately followed his
election, Marshall was busy reporting to Washington
on the best men to be appointed as officers in
the provisional army; and his letters to the Commander-in-Chief
show a wide and careful acquaintance
with Virginians of military training, and a
delicate judgment of their qualities.<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a></p>

<p>By now the hated Sedition Law was justifying
the political hydrophobia which it had excited
among the Republicans.<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> All over the country men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
were being indicted and convicted for wholly justifiable
political criticisms,&mdash;some of them trivial and
even amusing,&mdash;as well as for false and slanderous
attacks on public officers. President Adams himself
had begun to urge these prosecutions. He was particularly
bitter against the "Aurora," the Republican
organ, which, according to Adams, contained an
"uninterrupted stream of slander on the American
government."<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> He thought that the editor ought
to be expelled from the country.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a></p>

<p>All this was more fuel to the Republican furnace.
Wicked and outrageous as were some of these prosecutions,
they were not so extravagant as the
horrors which Republican politicians declared that
the Sedition Laws would bring to every fireside.</p>

<p>During the summer after his election Marshall
visited his father in Kentucky. Thomas Marshall
was ill, and his son's toilsome journey was solely for
the purpose of comforting him; but Jefferson could
see in it nothing but a political mission. He writes
to Wilson Cary Nicholas to prepare an answer to
the States that had opposed the Kentucky and Virginia
Resolutions; but, says Jefferson, "As to the
preparing anything [myself] I must decline it, to
avoid suspicions (which were pretty strong in some
quarters on the last occasion) [the Kentucky Resolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>tions]....
The visit of the apostle Marshall<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> to
Kentucky, excite[s] anxiety. However, we doubt
not that his poisons will be effectually counter-worked."<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson's suspicions were groundless. Marshall
did not even sound public opinion on the subject.
On his return to Richmond he writes the Secretary
of State, who was the most active politician of
Adams's Cabinet, and to whom Marshall freely
opened his mind on politics, that "a visit to an aged
&amp; rever'd Father" prevented an earlier answer to a
letter from Pickering; and, although Marshall has
much to say, not one word is written of the Kentucky
and Virginia Resolutions. He is obsessed
with the French question and of the advantage the
French "party in America" may secure by the impression
that France was not really hostile. "This
will enable her [France's] party in America to attack
from very advantageous ground the government of
the United States."<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a></p>

<p>Now came the public circumstance that made the
schism in the Federalist Party an open and remorseless
feud. The President's militant declaration,
that he would "never send another minister to
France without assurances that he will [would] be
received, respected, and honored as the represent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>ative
of a great, free, powerful, and independent
people,"<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> was perfectly attuned to the warlike spirit
of the hour. The country rang with approval. The
Federalist politicians were exultant.</p>

<p>Thereupon the resourceful Talleyrand wrote the
Secretary of the French Legation at The Hague to
intimate to Murray, the American Minister, that the
French Directory would now receive a minister from
the United States.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> Murray hastened the news to
Adams.<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> It was a frail assurance, indirect, irregular,
unacknowledged to the world; and from men who
had insulted us and who would not hesitate to repudiate
Murray's statement if their purposes so required.
Yet the President grasped by the forelock
this possibility for peace, and, against the emphatic
protest of his Cabinet, suddenly sent a second commission
to try again for that adjustment which
Marshall and his associates had failed to secure. It
was the wisest and most unpopular act of Adams's
troubled Administration.</p>

<p>The leading Federalist politicians were enraged.
Indeed, "the whole [Federalist] party were prodigiously
alarmed."<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> They thought it a national
humiliation. What! said they, kiss the hand that
had slapped our face! "The new embassy ... disgusts
most men here," reported Ames from New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
England.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> Cabot confirmed Ames's doleful message&mdash;"Surprise,
indignation, grief, &amp; disgust followed
each other in swift succession in the breasts of the
true friends of our country," he advised King.<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a></p>

<p>The Federalist leaders really wanted war with
France, most of them as a matter of patriotism;
some, undoubtedly, because war would insure party
success in the approaching presidential election.
Upon his return Marshall had prophesied formal
declaration of hostilities from the Republic of
France, when news of the dispatches reached Europe;
and the war Federalists were sorely disappointed
at the failure of his prediction. "Genl. Marshall
unfortunately held the decided opinion that France
would <span class="smcap">declare</span> war when the Dispatches should
appear; and T. Sewell with other good men were so
strongly impressed with the advantage of such a
declaration by them that they could not be persuaded
to relinquish the belief in it&mdash;I was astonished
that they should have attributed to the
French such miserable policy." So wrote the able
and balanced Cabot.<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> That France refused to adopt
"such miserable policy" as Marshall had expected
was sufficiently exasperating to the war Federalists;
but to meet that country three fourths of the way
on the road to peace was intolerable.</p>

<p>"The end [peace] being a bad one all means are
unwise and indefensible" was the ultra-Federalist
belief.<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> Adams's second mission was, they said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
party surrender to the Republicans; it was "a policy
that threatens ... to revive the Jacobin faction in
our bosom."<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> Federalist members of Congress
threatened to resign. "I have sacrificed as much as
most men ... to support this Govt. and root out
Democracy, &amp; French principles, but ... I feel it to
be lost and worse ... I can &amp; will resign if all must
be given up to France," cried the enraged Tracy.<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a></p>

<p>These "enemies of government" had said all
along that things could be arranged with France;
that the X. Y. Z. disclosures were merely a Federalist
plot; and that the army was a wicked and needless
expense. What answer could the Federalists make
to these Republican charges now? Adams's new
French mission, the Federalist chieftains declared,
was "a measure to <i>make</i> dangers, and to nullify
resources; to make the navy without object; the
army an object of popular terror."<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a></p>

<p>And the presidential election was coming on! To
hold the situation just as it was might mean Federalist
victory. Suppose events did develop a formal
declaration of war with France? That would
make Federalist success more certain. The country
would not turn out a party in charge of the Government
when cannon were roaring. Even more
important, an open and avowed conflict with the
"bloody Republic" would, reasoned the Federalist
leaders, check the miasmic growth of French revolutionary
ideas among the people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>

<p>In short, a declaration of war with France would
do everything which the Federalists wished and
hoped for. "Peace [with France] ... is not desired
as it should not be"<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> was their opinion of the statesmanship
demanded by the times. And now Adams,
without one word to the men who reluctantly had
made him President,<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> had not only prevented a rupture
which would have accomplished every Federalist
purpose, but had delivered his party into the
hands of the "Jacobins." He had robbed the
Federalists of their supreme campaign "issue."
"Peace with France, they think an evil and holding
out the hope of it another, as it tends to chill the
public fervor";<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> and the "public fervor" surely
needed no further reduction of temperature, for
Federalist health.</p>

<p>If Adams did not wish for a formal declaration
of war, at least he might have let things alone.
But now! "Government will be weakened by the
friends it loses and betrayed by those it will gain.
It will lose ... the friendship of the sense, and
worth, and property of the United States, and get
in exchange the prejudice, vice, and bankruptcy
of the nation,"<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> wrote Ames to Pickering. "In
Resistance alone there is safety,"<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> was Cabot's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
opinion. "The Jacobin influence is rising, and has
been ever since the mission to France was determined
on; ... if a Treaty be made with France their
[Republican] ascendancy will be sure";<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> and, after
that, the deluge.</p>

<p>The Federalist leaders felt that, even without a
declaration of hostilities by Congress, they might
make shift to win the approaching election. For on
the sea we already were waging war on France,
while formally at peace with her. Our newborn
navy was taking French privateers, defeating
French men-of-war, and retaliating with pike, cutlass,
and broadside for the piratical French outrages
upon American commerce.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> As things stood,
it was certain that this would continue until after the
election, and with each glorious victory of a Truxton
or a Hull, National pride and popular enthusiasm
would mount higher and grow stronger. So the
Federalist politicians thought that "the only negotiation
compatible with our honor or our safety
is that begun by Truxton in the capture of the
L'Insurgente."<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a></p>

<p>Priceless campaign ammunition was this for
the Federalist political guns. Early in the year the
bilious but keen-eyed watchman on the ramparts
of New England Federalism had noted the appearance
of "a little patriotism, and the capture of the
<i>Insurgente</i> cherishes it."<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> And now Adams's second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
mission might spoil everything. "The Jacobins will
rise in consequence of this blunder,"<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> was the doleful
prophecy. Indeed, it was already in fulfillment
even with the utterance: "Already the Jacobins
raise their disgraced heads from the mire of contempt!"<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>
The "country gentlemen" were the
hands as the business interests were the brain and
heart of the Federalist Party; "the President destroyed
their influence, and ... left them prostrate
before their vindictive adversaries."<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans were overjoyed. Adams had
reversed himself, eaten his own words, confessed
the hypocrisy of the "infamous X. Y. Z. plot."
"This renders their [Federalists'] efforts for war
desperate, &amp; silences all further denials of the sincerity
of the French government," gleefully wrote
Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a></p>

<p>Marshall alone of the commanding Federalists,
approved Adams's action. "I presume it will afford
you satisfaction to know that a measure which
excited so much agitation here, has met the approbation
of so good a judge as Mr. Marshall," Lee
reported to the President.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> Marshall's support
cheered the harried Chief Executive. "Esteeming
very highly the opinion and character of your friend
General Marshall, I thank you for inclosing his
letter," responded Adams.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<p>The President had done still worse. Auctioneer
John Fries, a militia captain, had headed an armed
mob in resistance to the National officers who were
levying the National direct tax on the houses and
lands of the farmers of eastern Pennsylvania. He
had been finally taken prisoner, tried, and convicted
of sedition and treason, and sentenced to
death. Against the unanimous written advice of
his Cabinet, formally tendered,<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> the President pardoned
the "traitor" and "his fellow criminals."<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>
And this clemency was granted at the plea of
McKean, the arch-"Jacobin" of Pennsylvania,<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a>
without even consulting the judges of the courts in
which they were twice tried and convicted.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a></p>

<p>What was this, asked the Federalist leaders in
dazed and angry amazement! Paralyze the arm of
the law! Unloose the fingers of outraged authority
from the guilty throat which Justice had clutched!
What was to become of "law and order" when the
Nation's head thus sanctioned resistance to both?<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>
In his charge to the Federal Grand Jury, April 11,
1799, Justice Iredell declared that if "traitors" are
not punished "anarchy will ride triumphant and all
lovers of order, decency, truth &amp; justice will be
trampled under foot."<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>How, now, could the Federalists repel Republican
assaults on this direct tax? How, now, could they
reply to the Republican attacks upon the army to
support which the tax was provided! In pardoning
Fries, Adams had admitted everything which the
hated Jefferson had said against both tax and army.<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a>
If Adams was right in pardoning Fries, then Washington
was wrong in suppressing the Whiskey
Rebellion. The whole Federalist system was abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a>
The very roots of the Federalist philosophy
of government and administration were torn from
their none too firm hold upon the scanty soil which
Federalist statesmen had laboriously gathered for
their nourishment. And why had Adams done this?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
Because, said the Federalist politicians, it was popular
in Pennsylvania;<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> that was the President's motive&mdash;the
same that moved him to send the new mission
to France.<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a></p>

<p>Bending under heavy burdens of state, harassed
by the politicians, Adams was enduring a private
pain sharper than his public cares. His wife, the
incomparable Abigail, was in Massachusetts and
seriously ill. The President had left her to meet
his Cabinet and dispatch the second mission to
France. That done, he hastened back to the bedside
of his sick wife. But the politicians made no
allowances. Adams's absence "from the seat of
government ... is a source of much disgust,"
chronicles the ardent Troup. "It ... has the air
of an abdication."<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> A month later he records that
the President "still continues at Braintree,<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> and
the government, like Pope's wounded snake, drags
its slow length along."<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></p>

<p>Such was the condition of the country and the
state of political parties when Marshall took his
seat in Congress. For the Federalists, the House was
a very "cave of the winds," with confusion, uncertainty,
suspicion, anger, and all the disintegrating
passions blowing this way and that. But the Republicans
were a compact, disciplined, determined
body full of spirit and purpose.</p>

mission, Washington received a letter from one "John Langhorne"
of Albemarle County. Worded with skillful cunning, it was designed
to draw from the retired President imprudent expressions that could
be used against him and the Federalists. It praised him, denounced
his detractors, and begged him to disregard their assaults. (Langhorne
to Washington, Sept. 25, 1797; <i>Writings</i>: Sparks, xi, 501.)
Washington answered vaguely. (Washington to Langhorne, Oct. 15,
1797; <i>Writings</i>: Ford, xiii, 428-30.) John Nicholas discovered that the
Langhorne letter had been posted at Charlottesville; that no person
of that name lived in the vicinity; and that Washington's answer was
called for at the Charlottesville post-office (where Jefferson posted
and received letters) by a person closely connected with the master
of Monticello. It was suspected, therefore, that Jefferson was the
author of the fictitious letter. The mystery caused Washington much
worry and has never been cleared up. (See Washington to Nicholas,
Nov. 30, 1797; <i>ib.</i>, footnote to 429-30; to Bushrod Washington,
March 8, 1798; <i>ib.</i>, 448; to Nicholas, March 8, 1798; <i>ib.</i>, 449-50.)
It is not known what advice Marshall gave Washington when the
latter asked for his opinion; but from his lifelong conduct in such matters
and his strong repugnance to personal disputes, it is probable
that Marshall advised that the matter be dropped.</p></div>

Judge Addison's charge was an able if intemperate interpretation of
the Sedition Law. The Republican newspapers assailed and ridiculed
this very effectively in the presidential campaign of 1800. "Alexander
Addison has published in a volume a number of his <i>charges</i> to

was one of the most brilliant young men that even Virginia
ever produced. See Adams: <i>Gallatin</i>, 212, 227. There is an interesting
resemblance between the uncommon talents and fate of young John
Thompson and those of Francis Walker Gilmer. Both were remarkably
intellectual and learned; the characters of both were clean, fine,
and high. Both were uncommonly handsome men. Neither of them
had a strong physical constitution; and both died at a very early age.
Had John Thompson and Francis Walker Gilmer lived, their names
would have been added to that wonderful list of men that the
Virginia of that period gave to the country.

The intellectual brilliancy and power, and the lofty character of
Thompson and Gilmer, their feeble physical basis and their early passing
seem like the last effort of that epochal human impulse which produced
Henry, Madison, Mason, Jefferson, Marshall, and Washington.</p></div>

that he "strictly required" their "solemn assurance" that no one else

Although this letter of Jefferson is positive and, in its particulars,
detailed and specific, Professor Channing has demonstrated that
Jefferson's memory was at fault; that no such conference took place;
and that Jefferson sent the resolutions to Nicholas, who placed them
in the hands of Breckenridge for introduction in the Kentucky Legislature;
and that Breckenridge and Nicholas both thought that the
former should not even see Jefferson, lest the real authorship of the
resolutions be detected. (See "The Kentucky Resolutions": Channing,

<h3>INDEPENDENCE IN CONGRESS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Constitution is not designed to secure the rights of the people of Europe
or Asia or to direct proceedings against criminals throughout the universe.
(Marshall.)</p>

<p>The whole world is in arms and no rights are respected but those that are
maintained by force. (Marshall.)</p>

<p>Marshall is disposed to express great respect for the sovereign people and to
quote their expressions as evidence of truth. (Theodore Sedgwick.)</p></div>


<p>"I have been much in Company with General
Marshall since we arrived in this City. He possesses
great powers and has much dexterity in the application
of them. He is highly &amp; deservedly respected
by the friends of Government [Federalists] from the
South. In short, we can do nothing without him.
I believe his intentions are perfectly honorable, &amp;
yet I do believe he would have been a more decided
man had his education been on the other side of the
Delaware, and he the immediate representative of
that country."<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a></p>

<p>So wrote the Speaker of the House of Representatives
after three weeks of association with the Virginia
member whom he had been carefully studying.
After another month of Federalist scrutiny, Cabot
agreed with Speaker Sedgwick as to Marshall's
qualities.</p>

<p>"In Congress, you see Genl. M.[arshall] is a
leader. He is I think a virtuous &amp; certainly an able
man; but you see in him the faults of a Virginian.
He thinks too much of that State, &amp; he expects the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
world will be governed according to the Rules of
Logic. I have seen such men often become excellent
legislators after experience has cured their errors.
I hope it will prove so with Genl. M.[arshall], who
seems calculated to act a great part."<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></p>

<p>The first session of the Sixth Congress convened
in Philadelphia on December 2, 1799. Marshall was
appointed a member of the joint committee of the
Senate and the House to wait upon the President
and inform him that Congress was in session.<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></p>

<p>The next day Adams delivered his speech to the
Senators and Representatives. The subject which
for the moment now inflamed the minds of the members
of the President's party was Adams's second
French mission. Marshall, of all men, had most
reason to resent any new attempt to try once more
where he had failed, and to endeavor again to deal
with the men who had insulted America and spun
about our representatives a network of corrupt intrigue.
But if Marshall felt any personal humiliation,
he put it beneath his feet and, as we have seen,
approved the Ellsworth mission. "The southern
federalists have of course been induced [by Marshall]
to vindicate the mission, as a sincere, honest, and
politic measure," wrote Wolcott to Ames.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></p>

<p>Who should prepare the answer of the House to
the President's speech? Who best could perform the
difficult task of framing a respectful reply which
would support the President and yet not offend the
rebellious Federalists in Congress? Marshall was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
selected for this delicate work. "Mr. Marshall, from
the committee appointed to draught an Address in
answer to the Speech of the President of the United
States ... reported same."<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> Although written in
admirable temper, Marshall's address failed to
please; the result was pallid.</p>

<p>"Considering the state of the House, it was necessary
and proper that the answer to the speech
should be prepared by Mr. Marshall," testifies Wolcott.
"He has had a hard task to perform, and you
have seen how it has been executed. The object was
to unite all opinions, at least of the federalists; it
was of course necessary to appear to approve the
mission, and yet to express the approbation in such
terms as when critically analyzed would amount
to no approbation at all. No one individual was
really satisfied; all were unwilling to encounter
the danger and heat which a debate would produce
and the address passed with silent dissent; the
President doubtless understood the intention, and
in his response has expressed his sense of the dubious
compliment in terms inimitably obscure."<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a>
Levin Powell, a Federalist Representative from Virginia,
wrote to his brother: "There were members
on both sides that disliked that part of it [Marshall's
address] where he spoke of the Mission to
France."<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a></p>

<p>The mingled depression, excitement, and resentment
among Marshall's colleagues must have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
great indeed to have caused them thus to look upon
his first performance in the House; for the address,
which, even now, is good reading, is a strong and
forthright utterance. While, with polite agreement,
gliding over the controverted question of the mission,
Marshall's speech is particularly virile when
dealing with domestic politics. In coupling Fries's
Pennsylvania insurrection with the Kentucky and
Virginia Resolutions Marshall displayed as clever
political dexterity as even Jefferson himself.</p>

<p>The address enumerates the many things for
which Americans ought to thank "the benevolent
Deity," and laments "that any portion of the people ... should permit themselves, amid such numerous
blessings, to <i>be seduced</i> by ... <i>designing men</i>
into an open resistance to the laws of the United
States.... Under a Constitution where the public
burdens can only be imposed by the people themselves,
for their own benefit, and to promote their
own objects, a hope might well have been indulged
that the general interest would have been too well
understood, and the general welfare too highly prized,
to have produced in any of our citizens a disposition
to hazard so much felicity, by the criminal effort
of a part, to oppose with lawless violence the will of
the whole."<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a></p>

<p>While it augured well that the courts and militia
co&ouml;perated with "the military force of the nation"
in "restoring order and submission to the laws,"
still, this only showed the necessity of Adams's
"recommendation" that "the judiciary system"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
should be extended. As to the new French mission,
the address "approves the pacific and humane policy"
which met, by the appointment of new envoys,
"the first indications on the part of the French
Republic" of willingness to negotiate; and "offers
up fervent prayers to the Supreme Ruler of the
Universe for the success of their embassy."</p>

<p>Marshall declares "the present period critical and
momentous. The important changes which are
occurring, the new and great events which are every
hour preparing ... the spirit of war ... prevalent
in almost every nation ... demonstrate" the need
of providing "means of self-defense." To neglect
this duty from "love of ease or other considerations"
would be "criminal and fatal carelessness." No one
could tell how the new mission would terminate:
"It depends not on America alone. The most pacific
temper will not ensure peace." Preparation for
"national defense ... is an ... obvious duty. Experience
the parent of wisdom ... has established
the truth ... that ... nothing short of the power
of repelling aggression will" save us from "war or
national degradation."<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a></p>

<p>Gregg of Pennsylvania moved to strike out the
italicized words in Marshall's address to the President,
but after a short debate the motion was defeated
without roll-call.<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a></p>

<p>Wolcott gives us a clear analysis of the political
situation and of Marshall's place and power in it at
this particular moment: "The federal party is composed
of the old members who were generally re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>-elected
in the northern, with new members from the
southern states. New York has sent an anti-federal
majority; Pennsylvania has done the same; opposition
principles are gaining ground in New Jersey and
Maryland, and in the present Congress, the votes
of these states will be fluctuating and undecided."</p>

<p>Nothing shows more clearly the intimate gossip
of the time than the similarity of Wolcott's and
Cabot's language in describing Marshall. "A number
of distinguished men," continues Wolcott, "appear
from the southward, who are not pledged by any
act to support the system of the last Congress; these
men will pay great respect to the opinions of General
Marshall; he is doubtless a man of virtue and distinguished
talents, but he will think much of the
State of Virginia, and is too much disposed to govern
the world according to rules of logic; he will read and
expound the constitution as if it were a penal statute,
and will sometimes be embarrassed with doubts of
which his friends will not perceive the importance."<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></p>

<p>Marshall headed the committee to inquire of the
President when he would receive the address of
the House, and on December 10, "Mr. Speaker, attended
by the members present, proceeded to the
President's house, to present him their Address in
answer to his Speech."<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> A doleful procession the
hostile, despondent, and irritated Representatives
made as they trudged along Philadelphia's streets
to greet the equally hostile and exasperated Chief
Magistrate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>

<p>Presidential politics was much more on the minds
of the members of Congress than was the legislation
needed by the country. Most of the measures
and practically all the debates of this remarkable
session were shaped and colored by the approaching
contest between the Federalists and Republicans
and, personally, between Jefferson and Adams.
Without bearing this fact in mind the proceedings of
this session cannot be correctly understood. A mere
reading of the maze of resolutions, motions, and
debates printed in the "Annals" leaves one bewildered.
The principal topic of conversation was, of
course, the impending presidential election. Hamilton's
faction of extreme Federalists had been dissatisfied
with Adams from the beginning. Marshall
writes his brother "in confidence" of the plots these
busy politicians were concocting.</p>

<p>"I can tell you in confidence," writes Marshall,
"that the situation of our affairs with respect to
domestic quiet is much more critical than I had
conjectured. The eastern people are very much
dissatisfied with the President on account of the
late [second] Mission to France. They are strongly
disposed to desert him &amp; push some other candidate.
King or Ellsworth with one of the Pinckneys&mdash;most
probably the General, are thought of.</p>

<p>"If they are deter'd from doing this by the fear
that the attempt might elect Jefferson I think it not
improbable that they will vote generally for Adams
&amp; Pinckney so as to give the latter gentleman the best
chance if he gets the Southern vote to be President.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this ill humor may evaporate before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
the election comes on&mdash;but at present it wears a
very serious aspect. This circumstance is rendered
the more unpleasant by the state of our finances.
The impost received this year has been less productive
than usual &amp; it will be impossible to continue
the present armament without another loan. Had the
impost produced the sum to which it was calculated,
a loan would have been unavoidable.</p>

<p>"This difficulty ought to have been foreseen when
it was determined to execute the law for raising the
army. It is now conceiv'd that we cannot at the
present stage of our negotiation with France change
the defensive position we have taken without much
hazard.</p>

<p>"In addition to this many influential characters
not only contend that the army ought not now to be
disbanded but that it ought to be continued so long
as the war in Europe shall last. I am apprehensive
that our people would receive with very ill temper
a system which should keep up an army of observation
at the expense of the annual addition of five
millions to our debt. The effect of it wou'd most
probably be that the hands which hold the reins
wou'd be entirely chang'd. You perceive the perplexities
attending our situation.</p>

<p>"In addition to this there are such different views
with respect to the future, such a rancorous malignity
of temper among the democrats,<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> such [an ap]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>parent
disposition&mdash;(if the Aurora be the index of
the [mind of] those who support it) to propel us to a
war with B[ritain] &amp; to enfold us within the embrace
of Fran[ce], [s]uch a detestation &amp; fear of France
among others [that I] look forward with more apprehension
than I have ever done to the future political
events of our country."<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

<p>On December 18 a rumor of the death of Washington
reached the Capital. Marshall notified the
House. His grief was so profound that even the dry
and unemotional words of the formal congressional
reports express it. "Mr. Marshall," says the
"Annals" of Congress, "in a voice that bespoke the
anguish of his mind, and a countenance expressive
of the deepest regret, rose, and delivered himself as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Speaker: Information has just been received,
that our illustrious fellow-citizen, the Commander-in-Chief
of the American Army, and the late President
of the United States, is no more!</p>

<p>"Though this distressing intelligence is not certain,
there is too much reason to believe its truth.
After receiving information of this national calamity,
so heavy and so afflicting, the House of Representatives
can be but ill fitted for public business.
I move, therefore, they adjourn."<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a></p>

<p>The next day the news was confirmed, and Marshall
thus addressed the House:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Speaker: The melancholy event which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
yesterday announced with doubt, has been rendered
but too certain.</p>

<p>"Our <span class="smcap">Washington</span> is no more! The Hero, the
Sage, and the Patriot of America&mdash;the man on
whom in times of danger every eye was turned and
all hopes were placed&mdash;lives now only in his own
great actions, and in the hearts of an affectionate
and afflicted people.</p>

<p>"If, sir, it has even not been usual openly to testify
respect for the memory of those whom Heaven
had selected as its instrument for dispensing good to
men, yet such has been the uncommon worth, and
such the extraordinary incidents, which have marked
the life of him whose loss we all deplore, that the
American Nation,<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> impelled by the same feelings,
would call with one voice for a public manifestation
of that sorrow which is so deep and so universal.</p>

<p>"More than any other individual, and as much
as to one individual was possible, has he contributed
to found this our wide-spread empire,<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> and to
give to the Western World its independence and its
freedom.</p>

<p>"Having effected the great object for which he
was placed at the head of our armies, we have seen
him converting the sword into the plough-share, and
voluntarily sinking the soldier in the citizen.</p>

<p>"When the debility of our federal system had
become manifest, and the bonds which connected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
the parts of this vast continent were dissolving, we
have seen him the Chief of those patriots who
formed for us a Constitution, which, by preserving
the Union, will, I trust, substantiate and perpetuate
those blessings our Revolution had promised to
bestow.</p>

<p>"In obedience to the general voice of his country,
calling on him to preside over a great people, we
have seen him once more quit the retirement he
loved, and in a season more stormy and tempestuous
than war itself, with calm and wise determination,
pursue the true interests of the Nation, and contribute,
more than any other could contribute, to the
establishment of that system of policy which will,
I trust, yet preserve our peace, our honor and our
independence.</p>

<p>"Having been twice unanimously chosen the
Chief Magistrate of a free people, we see him, at a
time when his re-election with the universal suffrage
could not have been doubted, affording to the world
a rare instance of moderation, by withdrawing from
his high station to the peaceful walks of private life.
However the public confidence may change, and the
public affections fluctuate with respect to others,
yet with respect to him they have in war and in
peace, in public and in private life, been as steady
as his own firm mind, and as constant as his own
exalted virtues.</p>

<p>"Let us, then, Mr. Speaker, pay the last tribute
of respect and affection to our departed friend&mdash;let
the Grand Council of the Nation display those
sentiments which the Nation feels. For this purpose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
I hold in my hand some resolutions which I will take
the liberty to offer to the House."<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a></p>

<p>The resolutions offered by Marshall declared
that:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The House of Representatives of the United
States, having received intelligence of the death of
their highly valued fellow-citizen, <span class="smcap">George Washington</span>,
General of the Armies of the United States,
and sharing the universal grief this distressing
event must produce, <i>unanimously resolve</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. That this House will wait on the President
of the United States, in condolence of this national
calamity.</p>

<p>"2. That the Speaker's chair be shrouded with
black, and that the members and officers of the
House wear mourning during the session.</p>

<p>"3. That a joint committee of both Houses be
appointed to report measures suitable to the occasion,
and expressive of the profound sorrow with
which Congress is penetrated on the loss of a citizen,
first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts
of his countrymen."<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a></p>

<p>Thus it came about that the designation of Washington
as "First in war, first in peace, and first in
the hearts of his countrymen" was attributed to
Marshall. But Marshall's colleague, Henry Lee,
was the author of these words. Marshall's refusal to
allow history to give him the credit for this famous
description is characteristic. He might easily have
accepted that honor. Indeed, he found it difficult to
make the public believe that he did not originate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
this celebrated phraseology. He presented the
resolutions; they stand on the record in Marshall's
name; and, for a long time, the world insisted on
ascribing them to him.</p>

<p>In a last effort to make history place the laurels
on General Lee, where they belong, Marshall,
three years before his death, wrote the exact
facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As the stage passed through Philadelphia," says
Marshall, "some passenger mentioned to a friend
he saw in the street the death of General Washington.
The report flew to the hall of Congress, and I
was asked to move an adjournment. I did so.</p>

<p>"General Lee was not at the time in the House.
On receiving the intelligence which he did on the
first arrival of the stage, he retired to his room and
prepared the resolutions which were adopted with
the intention of offering them himself.</p>

<p>"But the House of Representatives had voted on
my motion, and it was expected by all that I on the
next day announce the lamentable event and propose
resolutions adapted to the occasion.</p>

<p>"General Lee immediately called on me and
showed me his resolutions. He said it had now become
improper for him to offer them, and wished me
to take them. As I had not written anything myself
and was pleased with his resolutions which I entirely
approved, I told him I would offer them the next
day when I should state to the House of Representatives
the confirmation of the melancholy intelligence
received the preceding day. I did so.</p>

<p>"You will see the fact stated in a note to the pref<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>ace
of the Life of Washington on p. [441] v. [2] and
again in a note to the 5th vol. p. 765. Whenever the
subject has been mentioned in my presence," Marshall
adds in a postscript, "I have invariably stated
that the resolution was drawn by General Lee and
have referred to these notes in the Life of Washington."<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a></p>

<p>During the first session Marshall was incessantly
active, although his work was done with such ease
that he gave to his colleagues the impression of indolence.
Few questions came before the House on
which he did not take the floor; and none, apparently,
about which he did not freely speak his mind
in private conversation. The interminable roll-calls
of the first session show that Marshall failed to vote
only six times.<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> His name is prominent throughout
the records of the session. For example, the Republicans
moved to amend the army laws so that enlistments
should not exempt non-commissioned officers
and privates from imprisonment for debt. Marshall
spoke against the motion, which was defeated.<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> He
was appointed chairman of a special committee to
bring in a bill for removing military forces from election
places and "preventing their interference in
elections." Marshall drew this measure, reported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
it to the House, where it passed, only to be defeated
in the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a></p>

<p>Early in the session Marshall was appointed
chairman of the committee to report upon the cession
by Connecticut to the United States of that
priceless domain known as the Western Reserve.
He presented the committee report recommending
the acceptance of the lands and introduced the bill
setting out the terms upon which they could be
taken over.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> After much debate, which Marshall
led, Gallatin fighting by his side, the bill was passed
by a heavy majority.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's vote against abrogating the power of
the Governor of the Territory of the Mississippi to
prorogue the Legislature;<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> his vote for the resolution
that the impertinence of a couple of young
officers to John Randolph at the theater did not
call "for the interposition of this House," on the
ground of a breach of its privileges;<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> his vote
against that part of the Marine Corps Bill which
provided that any officer, on the testimony of two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
witnesses, should be cashiered and incapacitated
forever from military service for refusing to help
arrest any member of the service who, while on
shore, offended against the person or property of any
citizen,<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> are fair examples of the level good sense
with which Marshall invariably voted.</p>

<p>On the Marine Corps Bill a debate arose so suddenly
and sharply that the reporter could not record
it. Marshall's part in this encounter reveals his
military bent of mind, the influence of his army
experience, and his readiness in controversy, no less
than his unemotional sanity and his disdain of popular
favor if it could be secured only by sacrificing
sound judgment. Marshall strenuously objected to
subjecting the Marine Corps officers to trial by jury
in the civil courts; he insisted that courts-martial
were the only tribunals that could properly pass on
their offenses. Thereupon, young John Randolph of
Roanoke, whose pose at this particular time was extravagant
hostility to everything military, promptly
attacked him. The incident is thus described by one
who witnessed the encounter "which was incidentally
and unexpectedly started and as suddenly and
warmly debated":&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your representative, Mr. Marshall, was the
principal advocate for <i>letting the power remain with
courts martial and for withholding it from the courts
of law</i>. In the course of the debate there was some
warmth and personality between him and Mr.
Randolph, in consequence of the latter charging the
former with adopting opinions, and using argu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>ments,
which went to sap the mode of trial by
jury.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marshall, with leave, rose a third time, and
exerted himself to repel and invalidate the deductions
of Mr. Randolph, who also obtained permission,
and defended the inference he had drawn, by
stating that Mr. Marshall, in the affair of Robbins,<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a>
had strenuously argued against the jurisdiction of
the American courts, and had contended that it was
altogether an <i>Executive</i> business; that in the present
instance he strongly contended that the business
ought not to be left with the civil tribunals, but that
it ought to be transferred to military tribunals, and
thus the trial by jury would be lessened and frittered
away, and insensibly sapped, at one time by
transferring the power to the Executive, and at
another to the military departments; and in other
ways, as occasions might present themselves. The
debate happened so unexpectedly that the shorthand
man did not take it down, although its manner,
its matter, and its tendency, made it more deserving
of preservation, than most that have taken
place during the session."<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's leadership in the fight of the Virginia
Revolutionary officers for land grants from
the National Government, strongly resisted by
Gallatin and other Republican leaders, illustrates
his unfailing support of his old comrades. Notwith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>standing
the Republican opposition, he was victorious
by a vote of more than two to one.<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<p>But Marshall voted to rebuke a petition of "free
men of color" to revive the slave-trade laws, the
fugitive from justice laws, and to take "such measures
as shall in due course" free the slaves.<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> The
debate over this resolution is important, not only
as explaining the vote of Marshall, who came from
Virginia and was himself a slaveholder, as were
Washington and Jefferson, but also as showing the
mind of the country on slavery at that particular
time.</p>

<p>Marshall's colleague, General Lee, said that the
petition "contained sentiments ... highly improper ... to encourage."<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> John Rutledge of South Carolina
exclaimed: "They now tell the House these
people are in slavery&mdash;I thank God they are! if
they were not, dreadful would be the consequences....
Some of the states would never have adopted
the Federal form of government if it had not been
secured to them that Congress never would legislate
on the subject of slavery."<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

<p>Harrison Gray Otis of Massachusetts was much
disgusted by the resolution, whose signers "were
incapable of writing their names or of reading the
petitions"; he "thought those who did not possess
that species of property [slaves] had better leave the
regulation of it to those who were cursed with it."
John Brown of Rhode Island "considered [slaves]
as much personal property as a farm or a ship....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
We want money; we want a navy; we ought therefore
to use the means to obtain it.... Why should
we see Great Britain getting all the slave trade to
themselves; why may not our country be enriched
by that lucrative traffic?"<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> Gabriel Christie of
Maryland hoped the petition would "go under the
table instead of upon it."<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> Mr. Jones of Georgia
thought that the slaves "have been immensely benefited
by coming amongst us."<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a></p>

<p>Finally, after two days of debate, in which the
cause of freedom for the blacks was almost unsupported,
Samuel Goode of Virginia moved: "That the
parts of the said petition which invite Congress to
legislate upon subjects from which the General Government
is precluded by the Constitution have a
tendency to create disquiet and jealousy, and ought
therefore to receive the pointed disapprobation of
this House."<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> On this motion, every member but
one, including John Marshall, voted aye. George
Thacher, a Congregationalist preacher from Massachusetts,
alone voted nay.<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> Such, in general, and
in spite of numerous humanitarian efforts against
slavery, was American sentiment on that subject at
the dawn of the nineteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a></p>

<p>Five subjects of critical and historic importance
came before the session: the Federalists' Disputed
Elections Bill; the Republican attack on the pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>visional
army raised for the probable emergency of
war with France; the Republican attack on the Executive
power in the Jonathan Robins case; the Republican
onslaught upon the Alien and Sedition
Laws; and the National Bankruptcy Bill. In each
of these Marshall took a leading and determining
part.</p>

<p>Early in the session (January 23) the Republicans
brought up the vexed question of the Sedition Law.
A resolution to repeal the obnoxious section of this
measure was presented on January 29, and after a
hot debate was adopted by the close vote of 50 to
48. Marshall voted for the repeal and against his
own party.<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> Had he voted with his party, the Republican
attack would have failed. But no pressure of
party regularity could influence Marshall against
his convictions, no crack of the party whip could
frighten him.</p>

<p>Considering the white heat of partisan feeling at
the time, and especially on the subject of the Alien
and Sedition Laws; considering, too, the fact that
these offensive acts were Administration measures;
and taking into account the prominence as a Federalist
leader which Marshall had now achieved, his
vote against the reprobated section of the Sedition
Law was a supreme act of independence of political
ties and party discipline. He had been and still was
the only Federalist to disapprove, openly, the Alien
and Sedition Laws.<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> "To make a little saving for
our friend Marshall's address," Chief Justice Ells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>worth
sarcastically suggested that, in case of the repeal
of the Sedition Law, "the preamble ... should
read thus: 'Whereas the increasing danger and depravity
of the present time require that the law
against seditious practices <i>should be restored to its
full rigor</i>, therefore,' etc."<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<p>From the point of view of its probable effect on
Marshall's political fortunes, his vote appeared to
spell his destruction, for it practically left him outside
of either party. He abhorred the doctrine of State
Sovereignty which Jefferson now was making the
rallying-point of the Republican Party; he believed,
quite as fervently as had Washington himself, that
the principle of Nationality alone could save the
Republic. So Marshall could have no hopes of any
possible future political advancement through the
Republican Party.</p>

<p>On the other hand, his vote against his own party
on its principal measure killed Marshall's future as
a Federalist in the opinion of all the politicians of his
time, both Federal and Republican.<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> And we may
be certain that Marshall saw this even more clearly
than did the politicians, just as he saw most things
more clearly than most men.</p>

<p>But if Marshall's vote on the Sedition Law was
an act of insubordination, his action on the Disputed
Elections Bill was nothing short of party treason.
This next to the last great blunder of the Federalists
was in reality a high-handed attempt to control
the coming presidential election, regardless of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
votes of the people. It was aimed particularly at
the anticipated Republican presidential majority in
Pennsylvania which had just elected a Republican
Governor over the Federalist candidate.</p>

<p>On January 3, Senator Ross of Pennsylvania,
the defeated Federalist candidate for Governor of
that State, offered a resolution that a committee
should be appointed to consider a law "for deciding
disputed elections of President and Vice-President ... and ... the legality or illegality of the
votes given for those officers in the different states."
In a brief but pointed debate, the Republicans insisted
that such a law would be unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The Federalist position was that, since the Constitution
left open the manner of passing upon votes,
Congress had the power to regulate that subject and
ought to provide some method to meet anticipated
emergencies. Suppose, said Senator Ross, that "persons
should claim to be Electors who had never been
<i>properly</i> appointed [elected], should their vote be
received? Suppose they should vote for a person to
be President who had not the age required by the
Constitution or who had not been long enough a
citizen of the United States or for two persons who
were both citizens of the same State?... What situation
would the country be in if such a case was to
happen?"<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a></p>

<p>So lively was the interest and high the excitement
that Marshall did not go to Richmond when his fifth
child was born on February 13, 1800.<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> He spoke in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
the House February 12, and was appointed on an
important committee February 13.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

<p>On February 14, the bill was reported to the
Senate. Five days later the Republican organ, the
"Aurora," made shift to get a copy of the measure,<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a>
and printed it in full with a bold but justifiable
attack upon it and the method of its origin.<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> On
March 28, the bill passed the Senate by a strict
party vote.<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> It provided that a "Grand Committee,"
consisting of six Senators and six Representatives
elected by ballot and the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court, should take charge of the certificates
of electoral votes immediately after they had
been opened and read in the presence of Congress.</p>

<p>This Grand Committee was to be given power to
send for papers and persons and, in secret session,
to consider and <i>determine</i> all questions concerning
the election. Had bribery been employed, had force
been used, had threats or intimidation, persuasion
or cajolery polluted the voters?&mdash;the Grand Committee
was to decide these questions; it was to declare
what electoral votes should be counted; it was
to throw out electoral votes which it thought to be
tainted or improper; and the report of this Grand
Committee was to be final and conclusive. In short,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
it was to settle absolutely the Presidency; from its
decree there was to be no appeal.<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a></p>

<p>On March 31, this bill reached the House. While
no action was taken on it for more than two weeks,
it was almost the sole topic of conversation among
the members. In these cloak-room talks, Marshall,
to the intense disgust and anger of the Federalist
leaders, was outspoken against this attempt to seize
the Presidency under the forms of a National law.</p>

<p>Two weeks later Marshall expressed his opinion
on the floor. He thought that "some salutary
mode" to guard against election frauds and to settle
disputed presidential contests should be adopted;
but he did not think that the Senate should appoint
the chairman of the Grand Committee, and he
objected especially to the finality of its authority.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a>
He moved that these portions of the bill be stricken
out and offered a substitute.<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a></p>

<p>Opposed as he was to the measure as it came from
the Senate, he nevertheless was against its indefinite
postponement and so voted.<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> His objections
were to the autocratic and definitive power of the
Grand Committee; with this cut from the measure,
he was in favor of a joint committee of the
House and Senate to examine into alleged election
frauds and illegalities. The Senate bill was referred
to a special committee of the House,<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> which reported
a measure in accordance with Marshall's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
views.<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> After much debate and several roll-calls,
the bill, as modified by Marshall, passed the House.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's reconstruction of the Senate's Disputed
Elections Bill killed that measure. It no
longer served the purpose of the Federalist presidential
conspiracy. By a strict party vote, the
Senate disagreed with the House amendments;<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> and
on the day before adjournment, the bill was finally
disposed of by postponement.<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a></p>

<p>Thus did Marshall destroy the careful plans for
his party's further control of the National Government,
and increase the probability of the defeat of
his friend, John Adams, and of the election of his
enemy, Thomas Jefferson. Had not Marshall interfered,
it seems certain that the Disputed Elections
Bill would have become a law. If it had been enacted,
Jefferson's election would have been impossible.
Once again, as we shall see, Marshall is to
save the political life of his great and remorseless
antagonist.</p>

<p>Yet Jefferson had no words of praise for Marshall.
He merely remarks that "the bill ... has undergone
much revolution. Marshall made a dexterous
man&#339;uver; he declares against the constitutionality
of the Senate's bill, and proposes that the right of
decision of their grand committee should be controllable
by the <i>concurrent</i> vote of the two houses of
congress; but to stand good if not rejected by a concurrent
vote. You will readily estimate the amount
of this sort of controul."<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a></p>

<p>The party leaders labored hard and long with
Marshall while the Disputed Elections Bill was
before the House. Speaker Sedgwick thus describes
the Federalist plot and the paralyzing effect of
Marshall's private conversations with his fellow
members: "Looking forward to the ensuing election,"
writes the disgusted Speaker, "it was deemed
indispensable to prescribe a mode for canvassing
the votes, provided there should be a dispute.
There being no law in the state [Pennsylvania], the
governor had declined, and the jacobins [Republicans]
propagated the report ... that he would return
their votes. A bill was brought into the Senate
&amp; passed, wisely &amp; effectually providing against the
evil, by the constitution of a committee with ultimate
powers of decision.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marshall in the first place called in question
the constitutional powers of the legislature to delegate
such authority to a Committee. On this question
I had a long conversation with him, &amp; he finally
confessed himself (for there is not a more candid
man on earth) to be convinced.</p>

<p>"He then resorted to another ground of opposition.
He said the people having authorized the
members to decide, personally, all disputes relative
to those elections, altho' the power was not indelegable,
yet he thought, in its nature, it was too delicate
to be delegated, until experience had demonstrated
that great inconveniences would attend its
exercise by the Legislature; altho' he had no doubt
such would be the result of the attempt.</p>

<p>"This objection is so attenuated and unsub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>stantial
as to be hardly perceivable by a mind so
merely practical as mine. He finally was convinced
that it was so and abandoned it.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, however, he had dwelt so
much, in conversation, on these subjects that he had
dissipated our majority, and it never could again
be compacted. The consequence was that the bill
was lost."<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's most notable performance while in
Congress was his effort in the celebrated Jonathan
Robins case&mdash;"a speech," declares that capable
and cautious critic, Henry Adams, "that still stands
without a parallel in our Congressional debates."<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a>
In 1797 the crew of the British ship Hermione
mutinied, murdered their officers, took the ship to
a Spanish port, and sold it. One of the murderers
was Thomas Nash, a British subject. Two years
later, Nash turned up at Charleston, South Carolina,
as the member of a crew of an American
schooner.</p>

<p>On the request of the British Consul, Nash was
seized and held in jail under the twenty-seventh
article of the Jay Treaty. Nash swore that he was
not a British subject, but an American citizen, Jonathan
Robins, born in Danbury, Connecticut, and
impressed by a British man-of-war. On overwhelming
evidence, uncontradicted except by Nash, that
the accused man was a British subject and a murderer,
President Adams requested Judge Bee, of the
United States District Court of South Carolina, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
deliver Nash to the British Consul pursuant to the
article of the treaty requiring the delivery.<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a></p>

<p>Here was, indeed, a campaign issue. The land
rang with Republican denunciation of the President.
What servile truckling to Great Britain! Nay,
more, what a crime against the Constitution!
Think of it! An innocent American citizen delivered
over to British cruelty. Where now were our free
institutions? When President Adams thus surrendered
the Connecticut "Yankee," Robins, he
not only prostituted patriotism, showed himself a
tool of British tyranny, but also usurped the functions
of the courts and struck a fatal blow at the
Constitution. So shouted Republican orators and
with immense popular effect.</p>

<p>The fires kindled by the Alien and Sedition Laws
did not heat to greater fervency the public imagination.
Here was a case personal and concrete, flaming
with color, full of human appeal. Jefferson took
quick party advantage of the incident. "I think,"
wrote he, "no circumstance since the establishment
of our government has affected the popular mind
more. I learn that in Pennsylvania it had a great
effect. I have no doubt the piece you inclosed will
run through all the republican papers, &amp; carry the
question home to every man's mind."<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a></p>

<p>"It is enough to call a man an <i>Irishman</i>, to make
it <i>no murder</i> to pervert the law of nations and to
degrade national honor and character.... Look
at what has been done in the case of <i>Jonathan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
Robbins</i>," [<i>sic</i>] exclaimed the "Aurora." "A British
lieutenant who never saw him until he was prisoner
at Charleston swears his name is Thomas Nash."
So "The man is hanged!"<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a></p>

<p>For the purposes of the coming presidential campaign,
therefore, the Robins affair was made the
principal subject of Republican congressional attack
on the Administration. On February 4, the
House requested the President to transmit all the
papers in the case. He complied immediately.<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> The
official documents proved beyond a doubt that the
executed sailor had not been an American citizen,
but a subject of the British King and that he had
committed murder while on board a British vessel
on the high seas.</p>

<p>The selectmen of Danbury, Connecticut, certified
that no such person as Jonathan Robins nor any
family of the name of Robins ever had lived in that
town. So did the town clerk. On the contrary, a
British naval officer, who knew Nash well, identified
him.<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a></p>

<p>Bayard, for the Federalists, took the aggressive
and offered a resolution to the effect that the President's
conduct in the Robins case "was conformable
to the duty of the Government and to ... the 27th
article of the Treaty ... with Great Britain."<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a></p>

<p>Forced to abandon their public charge that the
Administration had surrendered an innocent Ameri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>can
citizen to British cruelty,<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> the Republicans
based their formal assault in Congress upon the
ground that the President had disobeyed the laws,
disregarded the Constitution, and taken upon himself
the discharge of duties and functions which
belonged exclusively to the courts. They contended
that, even if Nash were guilty, even if he were not
an American citizen, he should, nevertheless, have
been tried by a jury and sentenced by a court.</p>

<p>On February 20, Livingston of New York offered
the Republican resolutions to this effect. Not only
was the President's conduct in this serious business
a "dangerous interference of the Executive with
judicial decisions," declared the resolution, but the
action of the court in granting the President's request
was "a sacrifice of the Constitutional independence
of the judicial power and exposes the
administration thereof to suspicion and reproach."<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a></p>

<p>The House decided to consider the Livingston
resolutions rather than those offered by Bayard, the
Federalists to a man supporting this method of meeting
the Republicans on the ground which the latter,
themselves, had chosen. Thus the question of constitutional
power in the execution of treaties came
squarely before the House, and the great debate was
on.<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> For two weeks this notable discussion continued.
The first day was frittered away on questions
of order.</p>

<p>The next day the Republicans sought for delay<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>&mdash;there
were not sufficient facts before the House,
they said, to justify that body in passing upon so
grave a question. The third day the Republicans
proposed that the House should request the President
to secure and transmit the proceedings before
the South Carolina Federal Court on the ground
that the House could not determine the matter until
it had the court proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's patience was exhausted. He thought
this procrastinating maneuver a Republican trick
to keep the whole matter open until after the coming
presidential campaign,<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> and he spoke his mind
sharply to the House.</p>

<p>"Let gentlemen recollect the nature of the case,"
exclaimed Marshall; "the President of the United
States is charged by this House with having violated
the Constitution and laws of his country, by having
committed an act of dangerous interference with a
judicial decision&mdash;he is so charged by a member of
this House. Gentlemen were well aware how much
the public safety and happiness depended on a well
or a misplaced confidence in the Executive.</p>

<p>"Was it reasonable or right," he asked, "to receive
this charge&mdash;to receive in part the evidence in
support of it&mdash;to receive so much evidence as
almost every gentleman declared himself satisfied
with, and to leave the charge unexamined, hanging
over the head of the President of the United States ... how long it was impossible to say, but certainly
long enough to work a very bad effect? To him it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
seemed of all things the most unreasonable and unjust;
and the mischief resulting therefrom must be
very great indeed."</p>

<p>The House ought to consider the evidence it
already had; if, on such examination, it appeared
that more was needed, the matter could then be
postponed. And, in any event, why ask the President
to send for the court proceedings? The House
had as much power to procure the papers as the
President had. "Was he [the President] to be a
<i>menial</i> to the House in a business wherein himself
was seriously charged?"<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a></p>

<p>Marshall was aroused. To his brother he thus
denounces the tactics of the Republicans: "Every
stratagem seems to be used to give to this business
an undue impression. On the motion to send for
the evidence from the records of South Carolina
altho' it was stated &amp; prov'd that this would
amount to an abandonment of the enquiry during
the present session &amp; to an abandonment under circumstances
which would impress the public mind
with the opinion that we really believed Mr. Livingston's
resolutions maintainable; &amp; that the record
could furnish no satisfaction since it could not contain
the parol testimony offered to the Judge &amp; further
that it could not be material to the President
but only to the reputation of the Judge what the
amount of the testimony was, yet the debate took
a turn as if we were precipitating a decision without
enquiry &amp; without evidence."<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span></p>

<p>This Republican resolution was defeated. So was
another by Gallatin asking for the papers in the
case of William Brigstock, which the Republicans
claimed was similar to that of Jonathan Robins.
Finally the main question came on. For two hours
Gallatin made an ingenious argument in support of
the Livingston resolutions.<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a></p>

<p>The next day, March 7, Marshall took the floor
and made the decisive speech which put a period to
this partisan controversy. He had carefully revised
his argument,<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> and it is to this prevision, so unlike
Marshall's usual methods, that we owe the perfection
of the reporter's excellent transcript of his performance.
This great address not only ended the
Republican attack upon the Administration, but
settled American law as to Executive power in carrying
out extradition treaties. Marshall's argument
was a mingling of impressive oratory and judicial
finality. It had in it the fire of the debater and the
calmness of the judge.</p>

<p>It is the highest of Marshall's efforts as a public
speaker. For many decades it continued to be published
in books containing the masterpieces of American
oratory as one of the best examples of the art.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a>
It is a landmark in Marshall's career and a monument
in the development of the law of the land.
They go far who assert that Marshall's address is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
a greater performance than any of the speeches of
Webster, Clay, Sumner, or other American orators
of the first class; and yet so perfect is this speech
that the commendation is not extreme.</p>

<p>The success of a democratic government, said
Marshall, depended not only on its right administration,
but also on the public's right understanding
of its measures; public opinion must be "rescued
from those numerous prejudices which ... surround
it." Bayard and others had so ably defended
the Administration's course that he would only
"re&euml;stablish" and "confirm" what they had so well
said.</p>

<p>Marshall read the section of the Jay Treaty under
which the President acted: This provided, said he,
that a murderer of either nation, fleeing for "asylum"
to the other, when charged with the crime,
and his delivery demanded on such proof as would
justify his seizure under local laws if the murder
had been committed in that jurisdiction, must be
surrendered to the aggrieved nation. Thus Great
Britain had required Thomas Nash at the hands
of the American Government. He had committed
murder on a British ship and escaped to America.</p>

<p>Was this criminal deed done in British jurisdiction?
Yes; for "the jurisdiction of a nation extends
to the whole of its territory, and to its own citizens
in every part of the world.... The nature of civil
union" involves the "principle" that "the laws of a
nation are rightfully obligatory on its own citizens
in every situation where those laws are really extended
to them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>

<p>This "is particularly recognized with respect to
the fleets of a nation on the high seas." By "the
opinion of the world ... a fleet at sea is within the
jurisdiction of the nation to which it belongs," and
crimes there committed are punishable by that nation's
laws. This is not contradicted by the right of
search for contraband, as Gallatin had contended,
for "in the sea itself no nation has any jurisdiction,"
and a belligerent has a right to prevent aid being
carried to its enemy. But, as to its crew, every ship
carried the law of its flag.</p>

<p>Marshall denied that the United States had jurisdiction,
concurrent or otherwise, over the place of
the murder; "on the contrary, no nation has any
jurisdiction at sea but over its own citizens or vessels
or offenses against itself." Such "jurisdiction ... is personal, reaching its own citizens only";
therefore American authority "cannot extend to a
murder committed by a British sailor on board a
British frigate navigating the high seas." There is no
such thing as "common [international] jurisdiction"
at sea, said Marshall; and he exhaustively illustrated
this principle by hypothetical cases of contract,
dueling, theft, etc., upon the ocean. "A common
jurisdiction ... at sea ... would involve the power
of punishing the offenses ... stated." Piracy was
the one exception, because "against all and every
nation ... and therefore punishable by all alike."
For "a pirate ... is an enemy of the human race."</p>

<p>Any nation, however, may by statute declare an
act to be piratical which is not so by the law of nations;
and such an act is punishable only by that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
particular state and not by other governments. But
an act universally recognized as criminal, such as
robbery, murder, and the like, "is an offense against
the community of nations."</p>

<p>The Republican contention was that murder and
robbery (seizure of ships) constituted piracy "by the
law of nations," and that, therefore, Nash should
have been indicted and tried by American authority
as a pirate; whereas he had been delivered to Great
Britain as a criminal against that nation.</p>

<p>But, said Marshall, a single act does not necessarily
indicate piratical intent unless it "manifests
general hostility against the world"; if it shows an
"intention to rob generally, then it is piracy." If,
however, "it be merely mutiny and murder in a
vessel with the intention of delivering it up to the
enemy, it" is "an offense against a single nation and
not piracy." It was only for such murder and "not
piracy" that "Nash was delivered." And, indisputably,
this was covered by the treaty. Even if Nash
had been tried and acquitted for piracy, there still
would have remained the crime of murder over which
American courts had no jurisdiction, because it was
not a crime punishable by international law, but
only by the law of the nation in whose jurisdiction
the crime was committed, and to which the criminal
belonged.</p>

<p>American law and American courts could not deal
with such a condition, insisted Marshall, but British
law and courts could and the treaty bound America
to deliver the criminal into British hands. "It was
an act to which the American Nation was bound by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
a most solemn compact." For an American court
to have convicted Nash and American authorities
to have executed him "would have been murder";
while for them to have "acquitted and discharged
him would have been a breach of faith and a violation
of national duty."</p>

<p>It was plain, then, said he, that Nash should
have been delivered to the British officers. By
whom? The Republicans insisted that this authority
was in the courts. Marshall demonstrated that
the President alone could exercise such power. It
was, he said, "a case for Executive and not for
judicial decision." The Republican resolutions declared
that the judicial power extends to <i>all</i> questions
arising under the Constitution, treaties, and
laws of the United States; but the Constitution itself
provided that the judicial power extends only to all
cases "<i>in law and equity</i>" arising under the Constitution,
laws, and treaties of the United States.</p>

<p>"The difference was material and apparent," said
Marshall. "A case in law or equity was a term well
understood and of limited signification. It was a
controversy between parties which had taken a
shape for judicial decision. If the judicial power extended
to every question under the Constitution, it
would involve almost every subject proper for Legislative
discussion and decision; if to every question
under the laws and treaties of the United States, it
would involve almost every subject on which the
Executive could act. The division of power ...
could exist no longer, and the other departments
would be swallowed up in the Judiciary."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>The Constitution did not confer on the Judiciary
"any political power whatever." The judicial power
covered only cases where there are "parties to come
into court, who can be reached by its process and
bound by its power; whose rights admit of ultimate
decision by a tribunal to which they are bound to
submit." Such a case, said Marshall, "may arise
under a treaty where the rights of individuals acquired
or secured by a treaty are to be asserted or
defended in court"; and he gave examples. "But
the judicial power cannot extend to political compacts;
as the establishment of the boundary line
between American and British Dominions ... or
the case of the delivery of a murderer under the
twenty-seventh article of our present Treaty with
Britain....</p>

<p>"The clause of the Constitution which declares
that 'the trial of all crimes ... shall be by jury'"
did not apply to the decision of a case like that
of Robins. "Certainly this clause ... cannot be
thought obligatory on ... the whole world. It is
not designed to secure the rights of the people of
Europe or Asia or to direct and control proceedings
against criminals throughout the universe. It can,
then, be designed only to guide the proceedings of
our own courts" in cases "to which the jurisdiction
of the nation may rightfully extend." And the
courts could not "try the crime for which Thomas
Nash was delivered up to justice." The sole question
was "whether he should be delivered up to a foreign
tribunal which was alone capable of trying and
punishing him." A provision for the trial of crimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
in the courts of the United States is clearly "not a
provision for the surrender to a foreign Government
of an offender against that Government."</p>

<p>If the murder by Nash were a crime, it is one
"not provided for by the Constitution"; if it were
not a crime, "yet it is the precise case in which his
surrender was stipulated by treaty" which the President,
alone, must execute. That in the Executive
decision "judicial questions" must also be determined,
argued nothing; for this often must be the
case, as, for instance, in so simple and ordinary matter
as issuing patents for public lands, or in settling
whether vessels have been captured within three
miles of our coasts, or in declaring the legality of
prizes taken by privateers or the restoration of such
vessels&mdash;all such questions, of which these are familiar
examples, are, said Marshall, "questions of
political law proper to be decided by the Executive
and not by the courts."</p>

<p>This was the Nash case. Suppose that a murder
were "committed within the United States and the
murderer should seek an asylum in Great Britain!"
The treaty covered such a case; but no man would
say "that the British courts should decide" it. It
is, in its nature, a National demand made upon the
Nation. The parties are two nations. They cannot
come into court to litigate their claims, nor can a
court decide on them. "Of consequence," declares
Marshall, "the demand is not a case for judicial
cognizance."</p>

<p>"The President is the sole organ of the nation in
its external relations"; therefore "the demand of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
foreign nation can only be made on him. He possesses
the whole Executive power. He holds and
directs the force of the nation. Of consequence, any
act to be performed by the force of the nation is to
be performed through him. He is charged to execute
the laws. A treaty is ... a law. He must, then,
execute a treaty, where he, and he alone, possesses
the means of executing it."</p>

<p>This, in rough outline, is Marshall's historic speech
which helped to direct a new nation, groping blindly
and with infinite clamoring, to a straight and safe
pathway. Pickering immediately reported to Hamilton:
"Mr. Marshall delivered a very luminous argument
on the case, placing the 27th article of the
treaty in a clear point of view and giving constructions
on the questions arising out of it perfectly satisfactory,
but, as it would seem, wholly unthought
of when the meaning of the article was heretofore
considered. His argument will, I hope, be fully
and correctly published; it illustrates an important
national question."<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans were discomfited; but they were
not without the power to sting. Though Marshall
had silenced them in Congress, the Republican press
kept up the attack. "<i>Mr. Marshall</i> made an ingenious
and <i>specious</i> defence of the administration,
in relation to executive interference in the case of
<i>Robbins</i>," [<i>sic</i>] says the "Aurora," "but he was compelled
to admit, what certainly implicates both the
President and Judge Bee.... He admitted that an
American seaman was justifiable, in rescuing him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>self
from impressment, to put to death those who
kept him in durance.... Robbins [<i>sic</i>] claimed to
be an American citizen, and asserted upon his oath,
that he had been impressed and yet his claim was
not examined into by the Judge, neither did the
President <i>advise</i> and <i>request</i> that this should be a
subject of enquiry. The enquiry into his citizenship
was made <i>after</i> his surrender and execution,
and the evidence exhibited has a very suspicious
aspect.... Town clerks may be found to certify to
anything that Timothy Pickering shall desire."<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a>
Nevertheless, even the "Aurora" could not resist an
indirect tribute to Marshall, though paying it by
way of a sneer at Samuel W. Dana of Connecticut,
who ineffectually followed him.</p>

<p>"In the debate on <i>Mr. Livingston's</i> resolutions, on
Friday last," says the "Aurora," "Mr. Marshall
made, in the minds of some people, a very satisfactory
defense of the conduct of the <i>President</i> and
<i>Judge Bee</i> in the case of <i>Jonathan Robbins</i> [<i>sic</i>]. Mr.
Dana, however, thought the subject exhausted, and
very <i>modestly</i> (who does not know his <i>modesty</i>) resolved
with his inward man to shed a few more
rays of light on the subject; a federal judge, much
admired for his wit and humour, happened to be
present, when Mr. Dana began his flourishes.</p>

<p>"The judge thought the seal of conviction had
been put upon the case by Mr. Marshall, and discovered
symptoms of uneasiness when our little
Connecticut Cicero displayed himself to catch Mr.
Speaker's vacant eye&mdash;'Sir,' said the wit to a bye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>stander,
'what can induce that man to rise, he is
nothing but a shakebag, and can only shake out the
ideas that have been put into the members' heads
by Mr. Marshall.'"<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's argument was conclusive. It is one
of the few speeches ever delivered in Congress
that actually changed votes from one party to the
other in a straight-out party fight. Justice Story
says that Marshall's speech "is one of the most
consummate juridical arguments which was ever
pronounced in the halls of legislation; ... equally
remarkable for the lucid order of its topics, the profoundness
of its logic, the extent of its research,<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a>
and the force of its illustrations. It may be said of
that speech ... that it was '<i>R&eacute;ponse sans r&eacute;plique</i>,'
an answer so irresistible that it admitted of no
reply. It silenced opposition and settled then and
forever the points of international law on which the
controversy hinged.... An unequivocal demonstration
of public opinion followed. The denunciations
of the Executive, which had hitherto been harsh
and clamorous everywhere throughout the land,
sunk away at once into cold and cautious whispers
only of disapprobation.</p>

<p>"Whoever reads that speech, even at this distance
of time, when the topics have lost much of
their interest, will be struck with the prodigious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
powers of analysis and reasoning which it displays,
and which are enhanced by the consideration that
the whole subject was then confessedly new in many
of its aspects."<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

<p>The Republican leaders found their own members
declaring themselves convinced by Marshall's
demonstration and announcing their intentions of
voting with the Administration. Gallatin, Livingston,
and Randolph had hard work to hold their
followers in line. Even the strongest efforts of
these resourceful men would not rally all of their
shattered forces. Many Republican members ignored
the pleadings of their leaders and supported
Marshall's position.</p>

<p>This is not to be wondered at, for Marshall had
convinced even Gallatin himself. This gifted native
of Switzerland was the Republican leader of the
House. Unusually well-educated, perfectly upright,
thorough in his industry, and careful in his thinking,
Gallatin is the most admirable of all the characters
attracted to the Republican ranks. He had made
the most effective argument on the anti-Administration
side in the debate over the Livingston resolutions,
and had been chosen to answer Marshall's
speech. He took a place near Marshall and began
making notes for his reply; but soon he put his
pencil and paper aside and became absorbed in
Marshall's reasoning. After a while he arose, went
to the space back of the seats, and paced up and
down while Marshall proceeded.</p>

<p>When the Virginian closed, Gallatin did not come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
forward to answer him as his fellow partisans had expected.
His Republican colleagues crowded around
the brilliant little Pennsylvania Swiss and pleaded
with him to answer Marshall's speech without delay.
But Gallatin would not do it. "Answer it yourself,"
exclaimed the Republican leader in his quaint foreign
accent; "for my part, I think it unan<i>swer</i>able,"
laying the accent on the <i>swer</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a></p>

<p>Nicholas of Virginia then tried to reply, but made
no impression; Dana spoke to no better purpose,
and the House ended the discussion by a vote which
was admitted to be a distinctively personal triumph
for Marshall. The Republican resolutions were defeated
by 61 to 35, in a House where the parties
were nearly equal in numbers.<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a></p>

<p>For once even Jefferson could not withhold his
applause for Marshall's ability. "Livingston, Nicholas
&amp; Gallatin distinguished themselves on one
side &amp; J. Marshall greatly on the other," he writes
in his curt account of the debate and its result.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a>
And this grudging tribute of the Republican chieftain
is higher praise of Marshall's efforts than the
flood of eulogy which poured in upon him; Jefferson's
virulence toward an enemy, and especially
toward Marshall, was such that he could not see,
except on rare occasions, and this was one, any
merit whatever in an opponent, much less express it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall's defense of the army law was scarcely
less powerful than his speech in the Robins case; and
it reveals much more clearly Marshall's distinctively
military temper of mind.</p>

<p>Congress had scarcely organized when the question
came up of the reduction of the army. On this
there was extended debate. Nicholas of Virginia
offered a resolution to repeal the act for the provisional
army of which Washington had been the
Commander-in-Chief. The expense of this military
establishment greatly alarmed Nicholas, who presented
an array of figures on which his anxieties fed.<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>
It was nonsense, he held, to keep this army law on
the statute books for its effect on the negotiations
with France.</p>

<p>Marshall promptly answered. "If it was true,"
said he, "that America, commencing her negotiation
with her present military force would appear in the
armor which she could only wear for a day, the situation
of our country was lamentable indeed. If our
debility was really such ... our situation was truly
desperate." There was "no cheaper mode of self-defense";
to abandon it "amounted to a declaration
that we were unable to defend ourselves." It was
not necessary to repeal the law entirely or to put it,
"not modified," in full effect. Marshall suggested a
middle ground by which "the law might be modified
so as to diminish the estimated expense, without dismissing
the troops already in actual service."<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

<p>Answering the favorite argument made by the
opponents of the army, that no power can invade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
America, he asked: "What assurance have gentlemen
that invasion is impracticable?" Who knows
the real conditions in Europe?&mdash;the "effect of the
late decisive victories of France?... It was by no
means certain" that these had not resulted in the
release of forces which she "may send across the
Atlantic."</p>

<p>Why be precipitate? asked Marshall; by the opening
of the next campaign in Europe we should have
more information. Let us look the situation in the
face: "We are, in fact, at war with France, though
it is not declared in form"; commerce is suspended;
naval battles are being fought; property is "captured
and confiscated"; prisoners are taken and incarcerated.
America is of "vast importance to France";
indeed, "the monopoly of our commerce in time of
peace" is invaluable to both France and England
"for the formation of a naval power."</p>

<p>The Republicans, he said, had "urged not only
that the army is useless," but that we could not
afford the expense of maintaining it. "Suppose this
had been the language of '75!" exclaimed Marshall.
"Suppose a gentleman had risen on the floor of
Congress, to compare our revenues with our expenses&mdash;what
would have been the result of the
calculation?" It would have shown that we could
not afford to strike for our independence! Yet we
did strike and successfully. "If vast exertions were
then made to acquire independence, will not the
same exertions be now made to maintain it?"</p>

<p>The question was, "whether self-government and
national liberty be worth the money which must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
expended to preserve them?"<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> He exposed the sophistry
of an expensive economy. It should never be
forgotten that true economy did not content itself
with inquiring into the mere saving of the present
moment; it should take an enlarged view of the
subject, and determine, on correct calculations,
whether the consequence of a present saving might
not be a much more considerable future expenditure.</p>

<p>Marshall admitted that the reduction of the army
would certainly diminish the expense of the present
year, but contended that the present saving would
bear no proportion to the immense waste of blood,
as well as treasure, which it might occasion.<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> "And
consider," he exclaimed, "the effect the army already
had produced on the mind and conduct of France.
While America was humbly supplicating for peace,
and that her complaints might be heard, France
spurned her contemptuously and refused to enter on
a discussion of differences, unless that discussion was
preceded by a substantial surrender of the essential
attributes of independence."</p>

<p>"America was at length goaded into resistance,"
asserted Marshall, "and resolved on the system of
defense, of which the army now sought to be disbanded
forms a part." What was the result? "Immediately
the tone of France was changed, and she
consented to treat us as an independent nation.
Her depredations indeed did not cease; she continued
still to bring war upon us; but although peace
was not granted, the door to peace was opened."</p>

<p>If "a French army should be crossing the Atlantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
to invade our territory," would anybody insist on
disbanding our army? "Was it wise, then, to do so
while such a probability existed?" In a few months
we should know; and, if danger should disappear,
"the army expires by the law which gave it being."
Meantime the expense would be trifling.<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a></p>

<p>In a private letter Marshall states, with even more
balance, his views of the conflicting questions of the
expense involved in, and the necessity for, military
equipment. He regrets that a loan is "absolutely
unavoidable"; but "attention must be paid to our
defenses":&mdash;</p>

<p>"The whole world is in arms and no rights are
respected but those that [are] maintained by force.
In such a state of things we dare not be totally unmindful
of ourselves or totally neglectful of that
military position to which, in spite of the prudence
and pacific disposition of our government, we may
be driven for the preservation of our liberty and
national independence.</p>

<p>"Altho' we ought never to make a loan if it be
avoidable, yet when forc'd to it much real consolation
is to be deriv'd from the future resources of
America. These resources, if we do not throw them
away [by] dissolving the union, are invaluable. It
is not to be doubted that in twenty years from this
time the United States would be less burthen'd by a
revenue of twenty millions than now by a revenue
of ten. It is the plain &amp; certain consequence of our
increasing population &amp; our increasing wealth....</p>

<p>"The system of defence which has rendered this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
measure necessary was not [only] essential to our
character as an independent nation, but it has actually
sav'd more money to the body of the people
than has been expended &amp; has very probably prevented
either open war or such national degradation
as would make us the objects of general contempt
and injury.</p>

<p>"A bill to stop recruiting in the twelve additional
regiments has been brought in and will pass without
opposition. An attempt was made absolutely to disband
them, but [it] was negativ'd. It has been so
plainly prov'd to us that french aggression has been
greatly increased, &amp; that their contemptuous refusal
even to treat with us as an independent nation has
been entirely occasioned by a belief that we could
not resist them; &amp; it is so clear that their present
willingness to treat is occasioned by perceiving our
determination to defend ourselves, that it was
thought unwise to change materially our system at
the commencement of negotiation.</p>

<p>"In addition to this it had much weight, that we
should know in a few months the facts of our negotiation
&amp; should then be able to judge whether the
situation &amp; temper of France rendered an invasion
pro[bable]. Then would be the time to decide on
diminishing [or] augmenting our military forces.
A French 64 has it is said arrived in the west indies
&amp; three frigates expected."<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a></p>

<p>Although the debate dragged on and the army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
was attacked and defended with brilliant ability,
Marshall's argument remained the Gibraltar of the
Administration, upon which all the assaults of the
Republicans were centered unavailingly. For his
army speech was never answered. Only once more
during this debate did Marshall rise and then but
briefly, to bring his common sense to bear upon the
familiar contention that, if the country is in danger,
its citizens will rise spontaneously to defend it.
He said that it would be absurd to call men to
arms, as had been done, and then "dismiss them
before the service was performed ... merely because
their zeal could be depended on" hereafter.
He "hoped the national spirit would never yield to
that false policy."<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a></p>

<p>The fourth important subject in which Marshall
was a decisive influence was the National Bankruptcy
Law, passed at this session of Congress.
He was the second member of the committee that
drafted this legislation.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> For an entire month the
committee worked on the bill and reported it on
January 6, 1800.<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> After much debate, which is not
given in the official reports, the bill passed the
House on February 21 and the Senate March 28.<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a></p>

<p>While the "Annals" do not show it, we know
from the testimony of the Speaker of the House that
Marshall was the vital force that shaped this first
National Bankruptcy Act. He was insistent that
the law should not be too extensive in its provisions
for the curing of bankruptcy, and it was he who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
secured the trial by jury as to the fact of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>"It [the Bankruptcy Law] is far from being such
an one as I wished," writes Sedgwick. "The <i>acts</i>
in curing bankruptcy are too restricted, and the
trial of the question Bankrupt or not, by jury, will
be found inconvenient, embarrassing &amp; dilatory.
The mischief was occasioned by Virginia Theory.
It was the whim of General Marshall; with him a
<i>sine qua non</i> of assent to the measure, &amp; without
him the bill must have been lost, for it passed the
House by my casting vote."</p>

<p>"Besides the bankrupt bill, we have passed [only]
one more of great importance," writes the Speaker
of the House in a review of the work of the session.<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a>
Much of the Speaker's summary is devoted
to Marshall. Sedgwick was greatly disappointed
with the laws passed, with the exception of the
Bankruptcy Bill "and one other."<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> "All the rest
we have made here are, as to any permanently beneficial
effects, hardly worth the parchment on which
they are written. The reason of this feebleness is
a real feebleness of character in the house." Sedg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>wick
lays most of this at Marshall's door, and in
doing so, draws a vivid picture of Marshall the
man, as well as of Marshall the legislator:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Marshall was looked up to as the man whose
great and commanding genius was to enlighten &amp;
direct the national councils. This was the general
sentiment, while some, and those of no inconsiderable
importance, calculating on his foolish declaration,
relative to the alien &amp; sedition laws, thought
him temporizing while others deemed him feeble.</p>

<p>"None had in my opinion justly appreciated his
character. As his character has stamped itself on the
measures of the present session, I am desirous of
letting you know how I view it.</p>

<p>"He is a man of a very affectionate disposition,
of great simplicity of manners and honest &amp; honorable
in all his conduct.</p>

<p>"He is attached to pleasures, with convivial
habits strongly fixed.</p>

<p>"He is indolent, therefore; and indisposed to take
part in the common business of the house.</p>

<p>"He has a strong attachment to popularity but
indisposed to sacrifice to it his integrity; hence it is
that he is disposed on all popular subjects to feel the
public pulse and hence results indecision and <i>an
expression</i> of doubt.</p>

<p>"Doubts suggested by him create in more feeble
minds those which are irremovable. He is disposed ... to express great respect for the sovereign people,
and to quote their opinions as an evidence of
truth.</p>

<p>"The latter is of all things the most destructive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
of personal independence &amp; of that weight of character
which a great man ought to possess.</p>

<p>"This gentleman, when aroused, has strong reasoning
powers; they are almost unequalled. But
before they are excited, he has frequently, nearly,
destroyed any impression from them."<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a></p>

<p>Such was Marshall's work during his six months'
service in Congress, the impression he made, and the
estimate of him by his party friends. His "convivial
habits, strongly fixed," his great good nature, his
personal lovableness, were noted by his associates
in the National House of Representatives quite as
much as they had been observed and commented
on by his fellow members in the Virginia Legislature
and by his friends and neighbors in Richmond.</p>

<p>The public qualities which his work in Congress
again revealed in brilliant light were his extraordinary
independence of thought and action, his utter
fearlessness, and his commanding mental power.
But his personal character and daily manners applied
a soothing ointment to any irritation which
his official attitude and conduct on public questions
created in the feelings of his associates.</p>

<p>So came the day of adjournment of Congress; and
with it the next step which Fate had arranged for
John Marshall.</p>

<h3>CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I consider General Marshall as more than a secretary&mdash;as a state conservator.
(Oliver Wolcott.)</p>

<p>To Mr. Jefferson I have felt insuperable objections. The morals of the author
of the letter to Mazzei cannot be pure. (Marshall.)</p>

<p>You have given an opinion in exact conformity with the wishes of your
party. Come forward and defend it. (George Hay to Marshall.)</p></div>


<p>"The P. requests Mr. McHenry's company for
one minute," wrote President Adams to his Secretary
of War on the morning of May 5, 1800.<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> The
unsuspicious McHenry at once responded. The
President mentioned an unimportant departmental
matter; and then, suddenly flying into a rage, abused
his astounded Cabinet adviser in "outrageous"<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a>
fashion and finally demanded his resignation.<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> The
meek McHenry resigned. To the place thus made
vacant, the harried President, without even consulting
him, immediately appointed Marshall, who
"as immediately declined."<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> Then Adams tendered
the office to Dexter, who accepted.</p>

<p>And resign, too, demanded Adams of his Secretary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
of State.<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> The doughty Pickering refused<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a>&mdash;"I did
not incline to accept this insidious favor,"<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> he reported
to Hamilton. Adams dismissed him.<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> Again
the President turned to Marshall, who, deeply troubled,
considered the offer. The Federalist Cabinet
was broken to pieces, and a presidential election was
at hand which would settle the fate of the first great
political party in American history.</p>

<p>The campaign had already started. The political
outlook was dark enough before the President's
outburst; this shattering of his Cabinet was a wicked
tongue of lightning from the threatening clouds
which, after the flash, made them blacker still.<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a></p>

<p>Few Presidents have ever faced a more difficult
party condition than did John Adams when, by a
humiliating majority of only three votes, he was
elected in 1796. He succeeded Washington; the
ruling Federalist politicians looked to Hamilton as
their party chieftain; even Adams's Cabinet, inherited
from Washington, was personally unfriendly
to the President and considered the imperious New
York statesman as their supreme and real commander.
"I had all the officers and half the crew
always ready to throw me overboard," accurately
declared Adams some years later.<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a></p>

<p>Adams's temperament was the opposite of Washington's,
to which the Federalist leaders had so long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
been accustomed that the change exasperated them.<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a>
From the very beginning they bound his hands. The
new President had cherished the purpose of calling
to his aid the ablest of the Republicans, but found
himself helpless. "When I first took the Chair,"
bitterly records Adams, "I was extremely desirous
of availing myself of Mr. Madison's abilities, ...
and experience. But the violent Party Spirit of
Hamilton's Friends, jealous of every man who possessed
qualifications to eclipse him, prevented it.
I could not do it without quarreling outright with
my Ministers whom Washington's appointment had
made my Masters."<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the high Federalist politicians,
most of whom were Hamilton's adherents, felt that
Adams entertained for their leader exactly the same
sentiments which the President ascribed to them.
"The jealousy which the P.[resident] has felt of
H.[amilton] he now indulges toward P.[inckney],
W.[olcott] &amp; to'd <i>very many of their friends</i> who are
suspected of having too much influence in the Community,
&amp; of not knowing how to appreciate his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
[Adams's] merits.... The Consequence is that his
ears are shut to his best real friends &amp; open to Flatterers,
to Time servers &amp; even to some Jacobins."<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a></p>

<p>Adams, the scholar and statesman, but never the
politician, was the last man to harmonize these differences.
And Hamilton proved to be as inept as Adams.</p>

<p>After the President had dispatched the second
mission to France, Hamilton's followers, including
Adams's Cabinet, began intriguing in a furtive and
vicious fashion to replace him with some other Federalist
at the ensuing election. While, therefore, the
President, as a personal matter, was more than
justified in dismissing McHenry and Pickering (and
Wolcott also<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>), he chose a fatal moment for the
blow; as a matter of political strategy he should
have struck sooner or not at all.</p>

<p>At this late hour the great party task and duty
of the President was, by any and every honorable
means, to unite all Federalist factions for the impending
battle with the eager, powerful, and disciplined
Republicans. Frank and full conference,
tolerance, and conciliation, were the methods now
required. These might not have succeeded, but at
least they would not have irritated still more the
ragged edges of party dissension. Not only did the
exasperated President take the opposite course, but
his manner and conduct were acid instead of ointment
to the raw and angry wounds.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span></p>

<p>This, then, was the state of the Federalist Party,
the frame of mind of the President, and the distracted
condition of the Cabinet, when Marshall was
asked to become Secretary of State in the late spring
of 1800. He was minded to refuse this high station
as he had that of Secretary of War. "I incline to
think Mr. Marshall will decline this office also,"
wrote McHenry to his brother.<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> If he accepted, he
would be loyal to the President&mdash;his nature made
anything else impossible. But he was the personal
friend of all the Federalist leaders, who, in spite of
his disapproval of the Alien and Sedition Laws and
of his dissent from his party's plans in Congress, in
spite, even, of his support of the President's detested
second mission to France,<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> nevertheless trusted and
liked him.</p>

<p>The President's selection of Marshall had been
anticipated by the Republicans. "General Marshall ... has been nominated to hold the station of Secretary
of War," said the "Aurora," in an article
heavy with abuse of Pickering. "This ... however,
is said to be but preparatory to General Marshall's
appointment to succeed Mr. Pickering who is
expected to resign."<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span></p>

<p>Strangely enough the news of his elevation to the
head of the Cabinet called forth only gentle criticism
from the Republican press. "From what is said of
Mr. Marshall," the "Aurora" thought that he was
"as little likely to conciliate" France as Pickering.
He "is well known to have been the disingenuous
writer of all the X. Y. Z. Dispatches," which the
Federalists had "confessed to be one of the best
and most successful political <i>tricks</i> that was ever
<i>played off</i>.... General Marshall's fineering and
var[ni]shing capacity" was "well known," said the
"Aurora." "General Marshall consequently has
been nominated and appointed.... In genuine
federal principles, General Marshall is as inflexible
as Mr. Pickering; but in the negotiation with
France, the General may not have imbibed so strong
prejudices&mdash;and, having been one of the Envoys
to that Republic, he may be supposed to be more
conversant with some of the points in dispute,
than Col. Pickering, and consequently to be preferred.</p>

<p>"We find him very well spoken of in the <i>reformed
Gazettes of France</i>," continues the "Aurora," "which
being now under guardianship<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> may be considered
as speaking the language of the government&mdash;'<i>Le
Bien Inform&eacute;</i>,' after mentioning the motion
Gen. M. made in announcing to Congress the death
of Gen. Washington, adds&mdash;'This is the gentleman
who some time since came as Envoy from the <i>United
States</i>; and who so virtuously and so spiritedly re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>fused
to fill the pockets of some of <i>our gentry</i> with
Dutch inscriptions, and millions of livres.'"<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a></p>

<p>For nearly two weeks Marshall pondered over the
President's offer. The prospect was not inviting. It
was unlikely that he could hold the place longer than
three quarters of a year, for Federalist defeat in the
presidential election was more than probable; and
it seemed certain that the head of the Cabinet
would gather political cypress instead of laurel in
this brief and troubled period. Marshall consulted
his friends among the Federalist leaders; and, finally,
accepted the proffered portfolio. Thereupon the
"Aurora," quoting Pickering's statement that the
office of Secretary of State "was never better filled
than by General Marshall," hopes that "Gen. Marshall
will take care of his <i>accounts</i>," which that
Republican paper had falsely charged that Pickering
had manipulated corruptly.<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a></p>

<p>Expressing the Republican temper the "Aurora"
thus analyzes the new Federalist Cabinet: "The
Secretary of the Treasury [Oliver Wolcott]" was
"scarcely qualified to hold the second desk in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
Mercantile Counting-House"; the Attorney-General
[Charles Lee] was "without talents"; the Secretary
of the Navy [Benjamin Stoddert] was "a
small Georgetown politician ... cunning, gossiping, ... of no ... character or ... principles"; the
Secretary of War [Samuel Dexter] was no more fit
for the place than "his <span class="smcap">mother</span>"; and Marshall,
Secretary of State, was "more distinguished as a
<i>rhetorician</i> and a <i>sophist</i> than as a <i>lawyer</i> and a
<i>statesman</i>&mdash;sufficiently pliant to succeed in a corrupt
court, too insincere to command respect, or
confidence in a republic." However, said the
"Aurora," Adams was "able to teach Mr. Marshall
'l'art diplomatique.'"<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a></p>

<p>Some of the Federalist leaders were not yet convinced,
it appears, of Marshall's party orthodoxy.
Pinckney reassures them. Writing from Virginia,
he informs McHenry that "Marshall with reluctance
accepts, but you may rely on his federalism, &amp;
be certain that he will not unite with Jefferson &amp;
the Jacobins."<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> Two months later even the Guy
Fawkes of the Adams Cabinet declares himself more
than satisfied: "If the gentlemen now in office
[Marshall and Dexter] had declined," declares Wolcott,
"rage, vexation &amp; despair would probably
have occasioned the most extravagant conduct<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> [on
the part of the President]." After Marshall had been
at the head of the Cabinet for four months, Cabot
writes that "Mr. Wolcott thinks Mr. Marshall
accepted the secretaryship from good motives, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
with a view of preserving union, and that he and
Dexter, by <i>accepting</i>, have rendered the nation great
service; for, if they had refused, we should have had&mdash;<i>Heaven
alone knows whom!</i> He thinks, however,
as all must, that under the present chief they will be
disappointed in their hopes, and that if Jefferson is
President they will probably resign."<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a></p>

<p>In view of "the temper of his [Adams's] mind,"
which, asserts the unfaithful Wolcott, was "revolutionary,
violent, and vindictive, ... their [Marshall's
and Dexter's] acceptance of their offices is the best
evidence of their patriotism.... I consider Gen.
Marshall and Mr. Dexter as more than secretaries&mdash;as
state conservators&mdash;the value of whose services
ought to be estimated, not only by the good they do,
but by the mischief they have prevented. If I am
not mistaken, however, Gen. Marshall will find himself
out of his proper element."<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a></p>

<p>No sooner was Marshall in the Secretary's chair
than the President hastened to his Massachusetts
home and his afflicted wife. Adams's part in directing
the Government was done by correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a>
Marshall took up his duties with his characteristically
serious, yet nonchalant, patience.</p>

<p>The National Capital had now been removed to
Washington; and here, during the long, hot summer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
of 1800, Marshall remained amidst the steaming
swamps and forests where the "Federal City" was
yet to be built.<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> Not till October did he leave his
post, and then but briefly and on urgent private
business.<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a></p>

<p>The work of the State Department during this
period was not onerous. Marshall's chief occupation
at the Capital, it would appear, was to act as
the practical head of the Government; and even his
political enemies admitted that he did this well.
Jefferson's most partial biographer says that "under
the firm and steady lead [of Marshall and Dexter] ... the Government soon acquired an order,
system, and character which it never had before
possessed."<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> Still, enough routine business came to
his desk to give the new Secretary of State something
to do in his own department.</p>

<p>Office-seeking, which had so annoyed Washington,
still vexed Adams, although but few of these
hornets' nests remained for him to deal with.
"Your knowledge of persons, characters, and circumstances,"
wrote the President to Marshall concerning
the applications for the office of United
States Marshal for Maryland, "are so much better
than mine, and my confidence in your judgment and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
impartiality so entire, that I pray you ... give
the commission to him whom you may prefer."<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a>
Adams favored the son of Judge Chase; but, on the
advice of Stoddert of Maryland, who was Secretary
of the Navy, Marshall decided against him: "Mr.
Chase is a young man who has not yet acquired the
public confidence and to appoint him in preference
to others who are generally known and esteem'd,
might be deem'd a mere act of favor to his Father.
Mr. Stoddert supposes it ineligible to accumulate,
without superior pretensions, offices in the same
family."</p>

<p>Marshall generally trimmed his sails, however,
to the winds of presidential preference. He undoubtedly
influenced the Cabinet, in harmony with
the President's wish, to concur in the pardon of
Isaac Williams, convicted, under the Jay Treaty,
of waging war on the high seas against Great Britain.
Williams, though sailing under a French commission,
was a pirate, and accumulated much wealth
from his indiscriminate buccaneering.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> But the
President wrote Marshall that because of "the man's
generosity to American prisoners," and "his present
poverty and great distress," he desired to pardon
Williams.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a></p>

<p>Marshall informed the President that "repeated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
complaints are made to this department of the
depredations committed by the Spaniards on the
American commerce."<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> The French outrages were
continuing; indeed, our naval war with France had
been going on for months and Spain was aiding the
French. An American vessel, the Rebecca Henry,
had been captured by a French privateer. Two
Yankee sailors killed the French prize master in
recapturing the vessel, which was taken again by
another French sea rover and conveyed into a
Spanish port. The daring Americans were imprisoned
and threatened with death. Marshall thought
"proper to remonstrate and to threaten retaliation
if the prisoners should be executed."<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></p>

<p>The French ship Sandwich was captured by Captain
Talbot, an American officer, in a Spanish port
which Spain had agreed to transfer to France.
Marshall considered this a violation of our treaty
with Spain. "I have therefore directed the Sandwich
to be given up to the minister of his Catholic
Majesty,"<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> he advised the President. The Spanish
Minister thanked Marshall for his "justice" and
"punctuality."<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a></p>

<p>But Talbot would not yield his prize; the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
States Marshal declined to act. Marshall took
"measures<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> which will," he reported to the President,
"I presume occasion the delivery of this vessel,
unless ... the government has no right to interpose,
so far as captors are interested." Talbot's attitude
perplexed Marshall; for, wrote he, "if the Executive
of the United States cannot restore a vessel
captured by a national ship, in violation of the law
of nations, ... cause for war may be given by those
who, of all others, are, perhaps, most apt to give it,
and that department of the government, under
whose orders they are plac'd will be unable to correct
the mischief."<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a></p>

<p>That picturesque adventurer, Bowles, whose plots
and activities among the Indians had been a thorn
to the National Government since the early part of
Washington's Administration,<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> again became annoying.
He was stirring up the Indians against the
Spanish possessions in Florida and repeated his
claim of having the support of Great Britain. The
Spaniards eagerly seized on this as another pretext
for annoying the American Government. Measures
were taken to break Bowles's influence with the
Indians and to suppress the adventurer's party.<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a></p>

<p>But, although the President was of the opinion
that "the military forces ... should join [the Span<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>iards]
in an expedition against Bowles,"<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> Marshall
did not think "that the Spaniards require any military
aid; nor," continues he, "do I suppose they
would be willing to receive it.... American troops
in either of the Floridas wou'd excite very much
their jealousy, especially when no specific requisition
for them has been made, and when their own
force is entirely competent to the object."<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a></p>

<p>Liston, the British Minister, assured Marshall
that the British Government had no connection
with Bowles.<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> But, irritated by gossip and newspaper
stories, he offensively demanded that Marshall
"meet these insidious calumnies by a flat and
formal contradiction."<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> Without waiting for the
President's approval, Marshall quickly retorted:<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a>
the "suspicions ... were not entirely unsupported
by appearances." Newspaper "charges and surmises ... are
always causes of infinite regret" to the
Government "and wou'd be prevented if the means
of prevention existed." But, said Marshall, the
British Government itself was not blameless in that
respect; "without going far back you may find examples
in your own of the impunity with which a
foreign friendly nation [America] may be grossly libel'd."
As to the people's hostility to Great Britain,
he tartly reminded the British Minister that "in
examining the practice of your officers employ'd in
the business of impressment, and of your courts
of Vice Admiralty, you will perceive at least some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
of the causes, by which this temper may have been
produc'd."<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a></p>

<p>Sweden and Denmark proposed to maintain,
jointly with the United States, a naval force in the
Mediterranean to protect their mutual commerce
from the Barbary Powers. Marshall declined because
of our treaties with those piratical Governments;
and also because, "until ... actual hostilities
shall cease between" France and America, "to station
American frigates in the Mediterranean would
be a hazard, to which our infant Navy ought not
perhaps to be exposed."<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a></p>

<p>Incidents amusing, pathetic, and absurd arose,
such as announcements of the birth of princes, to
which the Secretary of State must prepare answers;<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
the stranding of foreign sailors on our shores, whose
plight we must relieve;<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> the purchase of jewels for
the Bey of Tunis, who was clamoring for the glittering
bribes.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a></p>

<p>In such fashion went on the daily routine work
of his department while Marshall was at the head of
the Cabinet.</p>

<p>The only grave matters requiring Marshall's attention
were the perplexing tangle of the British
debts and the associated questions of British impressment
of American seamen and interference
with American commerce.</p>

<p>Under the sixth article of the Jay Treaty a joint
commission of five members had been appointed
to determine the debts due British subjects. Two
of the Commissioners were British, two Americans,
and the fifth chosen by lot. Chance made this deciding
member British also. This Commission, sitting
at Philadelphia, failed to agree. The treaty
provided, as we have seen, that the United States
should pay such British debts existing at the outbreak
of the Revolutionary War as the creditors
were not able to collect because of the sequestration
laws and other "legal impediments," or because,
during the operation of these statutes, the
debtor had become insolvent.</p>

<p>Having a majority of the Commission, the British
members made rules which threw the doors wide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
open.<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> "They go the length to make the United
States at once the debtor for all the <i>outstanding</i> debts
of British subjects contracted before the peace of
1783.... The amount of the claims presented exceeds
nineteen millions of dollars."<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> And this was
done by the British representatives with overbearing
personal insolence. Aside from the injustice of the
British contention, this bullying of the American
members<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> made the work of the Commission all
but impossible.</p>

<p>A righteous popular indignation arose. "The construction
put upon the Treaty by the British Commissioners ... will
never be submitted to by this
country.... The [British] demand ... excites much
ill blood."<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> The American Commissioners refused
to attend further sittings of the Board. Thereupon,
the British Government withdrew its members of the
associate Commission sitting in London, under the
seventh article of the treaty, to pass upon claims
of American citizens for property destroyed by the
British.</p>

<p>The situation was acute. It was made still sharper
by the appointment of our second mission to France.
For, just as France had regarded Jay's mission and
treaty as offensive, so now Great Britain looked upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
the Ellsworth mission as unfriendly. As a way out
of the difficulty, the American Government insisted
upon articles explanatory of the sixth article of the
Jay Treaty which would define exactly what claims
the Commission should consider.<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> The British Government
refused and suggested a new commission.<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a></p>

<p>This was the condition that faced Marshall when
he became Secretary of State. War with Great Britain
was in the air from other causes and the rupture
of the two Commissions made the atmosphere
thicker. On June 24, 1800, Marshall wrote the President
that we ought "still to press an amicable
explanation of the sixth article of our treaty";
perhaps during the summer or autumn the British
Cabinet might feel "more favorable to an accommodation."
But he "cannot help fearing that ...
the British Ministry" intends "to put such a construction
on the law of nations ... as to throw into
their hands some equivalent to the probable claims
of British creditors on the United States."<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a></p>

<p>Lord Grenville then suggested to Rufus King, our
Minister at London, that the United States pay a
gross sum to Great Britain in settlement of the whole
controversy.<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> Marshall wondered whether this simple
way out of the tangle could "afford just cause of
discontent to France?"<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> Adams thought not. "We
surely have a right to pay our honest debts in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
manner least inconvenient to ourselves and no foreign
power has anything to do with it," said the
President. Adams, however, foresaw many other
difficulties;<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> but Marshall concluded that, on the
whole, a gross payment was the best solution in case
the British Government could not be induced to
agree to explanatory articles.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a></p>

<p>Thereupon Marshall wrote his memorable instructions
to our Minister to Great Britain. In this, as in
his letters to Talleyrand two years earlier, and in the
notable one on British impressment, contraband,
and freedom of the seas,<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> he shows himself an American
in a manner unusual at that period. Not the
least partiality does he display for any foreign
country; he treats them with exact equality and demands
from all that they shall deal with the American
Government as a <i>Nation</i>, independent of and
unconnected with any of them.<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a></p>

<p>The United States, writes Marshall, "can never
submit to" the resolutions adopted by the British
Commissioners, which put "new and injurious burthens"
upon the United States "unwarranted by
compact," and to which, if they had been stated in
the treaty, "this Government never could and never
would have assented." Unless the two Governments
can "forget the past," arbitration cannot be successful;
it is idle to discuss who committed the first fault,
he says, when two nations are trying to adjust their
differences.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span></p>

<p>The American Commissioners, declares Marshall,
withdrew from the Board because the hostile majority
established rules under which "a vast mass of
cases never submitted to their consideration" could
and would be brought in against American citizens.
The proceedings of the British Commissioners were
not only "totally unauthorized," but "were conducted
in terms and in a spirit only calculated to
destroy all harmony between the two nations."</p>

<p>The cases which the Board could consider were
distinctly and specifically stated in the fifth article
of the treaty. Let the two Governments agree to an
explanation, instead of leaving the matter to wrangling
commissioners. But, if Minister King finds that
the British Government will not agree to explanatory
articles, he is authorized to substitute "a gross
sum in full compensation of all claims made or to be
made on this Government."</p>

<p>It would, of course, be difficult to agree upon the
amount. "The extravagant claims which the British
creditors have been induced to file," among which
"are cases ... so notoriously unfounded that no
commissioners retaining the slightest degree of self-respect
can establish them; ... others where the
debt has been fairly and voluntarily compromised
by agreement between creditor and debtor"; others
"where the money has been paid in specie, and
receipts in full given"; and still others even worse,
all composing that "enormous mass of imagined
debt," will, says Marshall, make it hard to agree on
a stated amount.<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span></p>

<p>The British creditors, he asserts, had been and
then were proceeding to collect their debts through
the American courts, and "had they not been seduced
into the opinion that the trouble and expense
inseparable from the pursuit of the old debts, might
be avoided by one general resort to the United
States, it is believed they would have been still more
rapidly proceeding in the collection of the very
claims, so far as they are just, which have been filed
with the commissioners. They meet with no objection,
either of law or fact, which are not common to
every description of creditors, in every country....
Our judges are even liberal in their construction of
the 4th article of the treaty of peace" and have
shown "no sort of partiality for the debtors."</p>

<p>Marshall urges this point with great vigor, and
concludes that, if a gross amount can be agreed
upon, the American Minister must see to it, of course,
that this sum is made as small as possible, not "to
exceed one million sterling" in any event.<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> In a
private letter, Marshall informs King that "the best
opinion here is that not more than two million Dollars
could justly be chargeable to the United States
under the treaty."<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a></p>

<p>Adams was elated by Marshall's letter. "I know
not," he wrote, "how the subject could have been
better digested."<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost from the exchange of ratifications of the
Jay compact, impressment of American seamen by
the British and their taking from American ships, as
contraband, merchandise which, under the treaty,
was exempt from seizure, had injured American
commerce and increasingly irritated the American
people.<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> The brutality with which the British practiced
these depredations had heated still more American
resentment, already greatly inflamed.<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a></p>

<p>In June, 1799, Marshall's predecessor had instructed
King "to persevere ... in denying the
right of British Men of War to take from our Ships
of War any men whatever, and from our merchant
vessels any Americans, or foreigners, or even Englishmen."<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>
But the British had disregarded the
American Minister's protests and these had now
been entirely silenced by the break-up of the British
Debts Commissions.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Marshall directed our Minister at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
the Court of St. James to renew the negotiations. In
a state paper which, in ability, dignity, and eloquence,
suggests his famous Jonathan Robins speech
and equals his memorial to Talleyrand, he examines
the vital subjects of impressment, contraband, and
the rights of neutral commerce.</p>

<p>It was a difficult situation that confronted the
American Secretary of State. He had to meet and
if possible modify the offensive, determined, and
wholly unjust British position by a statement of
principles based on fundamental right; and by an
assertion of America's just place in the world.</p>

<p>The spirit of Marshall's protest to the British Government
is that America is an independent nation,
a separate and distinct political entity, with equal
rights, power, and dignity with all other nations<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>&mdash;a
conception then in its weak infancy even in America
and, apparently, not entertained by Great Britain or
France. These Powers seemed to regard America,
not as a sovereign nation, but as a sort of subordinate
state, to be used as they saw fit for their plans and
purposes.</p>

<p>But, asserts Marshall, "the United States do not
hold themselves in any degree responsible to France
or to Britain for their negotiations with the one or
the other of these Powers, but are ready to make
amicable and reasonable explanations with either....
An exact neutrality ... between the belligerent
Powers" is the "object of the American Government....
Separated far from Europe, we mean not
to mingle in their quarrels.... We have avoided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
and we shall continue to avoid any ... connections
not compatible with the neutrality we profess....
The aggressions, sometimes of one and sometimes of
another belligerent power have forced us to contemplate
and prepare for war as a probable event....
But this is a situation of necessity, not of choice."
France had compelled us to resort to force against
her, but in doing so "our preference for peace was
manifest"; and now that France makes friendly
advances, "America meets those overtures, and, in
doing so, only adheres to her pacific system."</p>

<p>Marshall lays down those principles of international
conduct which have become the traditional
American policy. Reviewing our course during the
war between France and Great Britain, he says:
"When the combination against France was most formidable,
when, if ever, it was dangerous to acknowledge
her new Government" and maintain friendly
relations with the new Republic, "the American
Government openly declared its determination to
adhere to that state of impartial neutrality which it
has ever since sought to maintain; nor did the clouds
which, for a time, lowered over the fortunes of the
[French] Republic, in any degree shake this resolution.
When victory changed sides and France, in
turn, threatened those who did not arrange themselves
under her banners, America, pursuing with
undeviating step the same steady course," nevertheless
made a treaty with Great Britain; "nor could
either threats or artifices prevent its ratification."</p>

<p>"At no period of the war," Marshall reminds the
British Government, "has France occupied such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
elevated ground as at the very point of time when
America armed to resist her: triumphant and victorious
everywhere, she had dictated a peace to her
enemies on the continent and had refused one to
Britain." On the other hand, "in the reverse of her
fortune, when defeated both in Italy and on the
Rhine, in danger of losing Holland, before the victory
of Massena had changed the face of the last
campaign, and before Russia had receded from the
coalition against her, the present negotiation [between
America and France] was resolved on. During
this pendency," says Marshall, "the state of the
war has changed, but the conduct of the United
States" has not.</p>

<p>"Our terms remain the same: we still pursue peace.
We still embrace it, if it can be obtained without
violating our national honor or our national faith;
but we will reject without hesitation all propositions
which may compromit the one or the other."</p>

<p>All this, he declares, "shows how steadily it [the
American Government] pursues its system [Neutrality
and peace] without regarding the dangers
from the one side or the other, to which the pursuit
may be exposed. The present negotiation with
France is a part of this system, and ought, therefore,
to excite in Great Britain no feelings unfriendly to
the United States."</p>

<p>Marshall then takes up the British position as to
contraband of war. He declares that even under the
law of nations, "neutrals have a right to carry on
their usual commerce; belligerents have a right to
prevent them from supplying the enemy with instru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>ments
of war." But the eighteenth article of the
treaty itself covered the matter in express terms,
and specifically enumerated certain things as contraband
and also "generally whatever may serve
<i>directly</i> to the equipment of vessels." Yet Great
Britain had ruthlessly seized and condemned American
vessels regardless of the treaty&mdash;had actually
plundered American ships of farming material upon
the pretense that these articles might, by some remote
possibility, be used "to equip vessels." The
British contention erased the word "<i>directly</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> from
the express terms of the treaty. "This construction
we deem alike unfriendly and unjust," he says. Such
"garbling a compact ... is to substitute another
agreement for that of the parties...."</p>

<p>"It would swell the list of contraband to" suit
British convenience, contrary to "the laws and
usages of nations.... It would prohibit ... articles ... necessary for the ordinary occupations of men in
peace" and require "a surrender, on the part of the
United States, of rights in themselves unquestionable,
and the exercise of which is essential to themselves....
A construction so absurd and so odious
ought to be rejected."<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a></p>

<p>Articles, "even if contraband," should not be confiscated,
insists Marshall, except when "they are
attempted to be carried to an enemy." For instance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
"vessels bound to New Orleans and laden with
cargoes proper for the ordinary use of the citizens
of the United States who inhabit the Mississippi
and its waters ... cannot be justly said to carry
those cargoes to an enemy.... Such a cargo is not
a just object of confiscation, although a part of it
should also be deemed proper for the equipment of
vessels, because it is not attempted to be carried to
an enemy."</p>

<p>On the subject of blockade, Marshall questions
whether "the right to confiscate vessels bound to a
blockaded port ... can be applied to a place not
completely invested by land as well as by sea." But
waiving "this departure from principle," the American
complaint "is that ports not effectually blockaded
by a force capable of completely investing
them, have yet been declared in a state of blockage,
and vessels attempting to enter therein have been
seized, and, on that account, confiscated." This
"vexation ... may be carried, if not resisted, to a
very injurious extent."</p>

<p>If neutrals submit to it, "then every port of the
belligerent powers may at all times be declared in
that [blockaded] state and the commerce of neutrals
be thereby subjected to universal capture." But if
complete blockage be required, then "the capacity
to blockade will be limited by the naval force of the
belligerent, and, of consequence, the mischief to
neutral commerce can not be very extensive. It is
therefore of the last importance to neutrals that this
principle be maintained unimpaired."</p>

<p>The British Courts of Vice-Admiralty, says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
Marshall, render "unjust decisions" in the case of
captures. "The temptation which a rich neutral
commerce offers to unprincipled avarice, at all times
powerful, becomes irresistible unless strong and
efficient restraints be imposed by the Government
which employs it." If such restraints are not imposed,
the belligerent Government thereby "causes
the injuries it tolerates." Just this, says Marshall,
is the case with the British Government.</p>

<p>For "the most effectual restraint is an impartial
judiciary, which will decide impartially between the
parties and uniformly condemn the captor in costs
and damages, where the seizure has been made
without probable cause." If this is not done, "indiscriminate
captures will be made." If an "unjust
judge" condemns the captured vessel, the profit is
the captor's; if the vessel is discharged, the loss falls
upon the owner. Yet this has been and still is the indefensible
course pursued against American commerce.</p>

<p>"The British Courts of Vice Admiralty, whatever
may be the case, seldom acquit and when they do,
costs and damages for detention are never awarded."
Marshall demands that the British Government
shall "infuse a spirit of justice and respect for law
into the Courts of Vice Admiralty"&mdash;this alone, he
insists, can check "their excessive and irritating
vexations.... This spirit can only be infused by
uniformly discountenancing and punishing those
who tarnish alike the seat of justice and the honor of
their country, by converting themselves from judges
into mere instruments of plunder." And Marshall
broadly intimates that these courts are corrupt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span></p>

<p>As to British impressment, "no right has been
asserted to impress" Americans; "yet they are
impressed, they are dragged on board British ships
of war with the evidence of citizenship in their
hands, and forced by violence there to serve until
conclusive testimonials of their birth can be obtained."
He demands that the British Government
stop this lawless, violent practice "by punishing and
frowning upon those who perpetrate it. The mere
release of the injured, after a long course of service
and of suffering, is no compensation for the past and
no security for the future.... The United States
therefore require positively that their seamen ...
be exempt from impressments." Even "alien seamen,
not British subjects, engaged in our merchant
service ought to be equally exempt with citizens
from impressments.... Britain has no pretext of
right to their persons or to their service. To tear
them, then, from our possession is, at the same time,
an insult and an injury. It is an act of violence for
which there exists no palliative."</p>

<p>Suppose, says Marshall, that America should do
the things Great Britain was doing? "Should we
impress from the merchant service of Britain not
only Americans but foreigners, and even British
subjects, how long would such a course of injury,
unredressed, be permitted to pass unrevenged?
How long would the [British] Government be content
with unsuccessful remonstrance and unavailing
memorials?"</p>

<p>Or, were America to retaliate by inducing British
sailors to enter the more attractive American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
service, as America might lawfully do, how would
Great Britain look upon it? Therefore, concludes
Marshall, "is it not more advisable to desist from,
and to take effectual measures to prevent an acknowledged
wrong, than be perseverant in that
wrong, to excite against themselves the well founded
resentment of America, and to force our Government
into measures which may possibly terminate
in an open rupture?"<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a></p>

<p>Thus boldly and in justifiably harsh language
did Marshall assert American rights as against
British violation of them, just as he had similarly upheld
those rights against French assault. Although
France desisted from her lawless practices after
Adams's second mission negotiated with Bonaparte
an adjustment of our grievances,<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> Great Britain
persisted in the ruthless conduct which Marshall and
his successors denounced until, twelve years later,
America was driven to armed resistance.</p>

<p>Working patiently in his stuffy office amidst the
Potomac miasma and mosquitoes during the sweltering
months, it was Marshall's unhappy fate to
behold the beginning of the break-up of that great
party which had built our ship of state, set it upon
the waters, navigated it for twelve tempestuous
years, through the storms of domestic trouble and
foreign danger.<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> He was powerless to stay the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
Federalist disintegration. Even in his home district
Marshall's personal strength had turned to water,
and at the election of his successor in Congress, his
party was utterly crushed. "Mr. Mayo, who was
proposed to succeed Gen. Marshall, lost his election
by an immense majority," writes the alert Wolcott;
"was grossly insulted in public by a brother-in-law
of the late Senator Taylor, and was afterwards
wounded by him in a duel. This is a specimen of
the political influence of the Secretary of State in his
own district."<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a></p>

<p>Marshall himself was extremely depressed. "Ill
news from Virginia," he writes Otis. "To succeed
me has been elected by an immense majority one of
the most decided democrats<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> in the union." Upon
the political horizon Marshall beheld only storm and
blackness: "In Jersey, too, I am afraid things are
going badly. In Maryland the full force of parties
will be tried but the issue I should feel confident
would be right if there did not appear to be a current
setting against us of which the force is incalculable.
There is a tide in the affairs of nations,
of parties, and of individuals. I fear that of real
Americanism is on the ebb."<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> Never, perhaps, in
the history of political parties was calm, dispassionate
judgment and steady courage needed more than
they were now required to avert Federalist defeat.</p>

<p>Yet in all the States revenge, apprehension, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
despair blinded the eyes and deranged the councils
of the supreme Federalist managers.<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> The voters in
the party were confused and angered by the dissensions
of those to whom they looked for guidance.<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a>
The leaders agreed that Jefferson was the bearer of
the flag of "anarchy and sedition," captain of the
hordes of "lawlessness," and, above all, the remorseless
antagonist of Nationalism. What should be done
"by the friends of order and true liberty to keep the
[presidential] chair from being occupied by an enemy
[Jefferson] of both?" was the question which the
distressed Federalist politicians asked one another.<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a></p>

<p>In May, Hamilton thought that "to support
<i>Adams</i> and <i>Pinckney</i> equally is the only thing that
can save us from the fangs of <i>Jefferson</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> Yet, six
days later, Hamilton wrote that "<i>most</i> of the most
<i>influential men</i> of that [Federalist] party consider
him [Adams] as a very <i>unfit</i> and <i>incapable</i> character....
My mind is made up. I will never more be
responsible for him by any direct support, even
though the consequence should be the election of <i>Jefferson</i>....
If the cause is to be sacrificed to a weak
and perverse man, I withdraw from the party."<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a></p>

<p>As the summer wore on, so acrimonious grew the
feeling of Hamilton's supporters toward the Presi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>dent
that they seriously considered whether his
re&euml;lection would not be as great a misfortune as
the success of the Republican Party.<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> Although
the Federalist caucus had agreed to support Adams
and Pinckney equally as the party's candidates for
President,<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> yet the Hamiltonian faction decided to
place Pinckney in the presidential chair.<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a></p>

<p>But, blindly as they groped, their failing vision was
still clear enough to discern that the small local leaders
in New England, which was the strong Federalist
section of the country, were for Adams;<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> and that
everywhere the party's rank and file, though irri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>tated
and perplexed, were standing by the President.
His real statesmanship had made an impression on
the masses of his party: Dayton declared that Adams
was "the most popular man in the United States."<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a>
Knox assured the President that "the great body
of the federal sentiment confide implicitly in your
knowledge and virtue.... They will ... cling to
you in preference to all others."<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a></p>

<p>Some urged Adams to overthrow the Hamiltonian
cabal which opposed him. "Cunning half Jacobins
assure the President that he can combine the virtuous
and moderate men of both parties, and that all
our difficulties are owing to an oligarchy which it is
in his power to crush, and thus acquire the general
support of the nation,"<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> testifies Wolcott.</p>

<p>The President heeded this mad counsel. Hamilton
and his crew were not the party, said Adams; they
were only a faction and a "British faction" at that.<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
He would "rip it up."<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> The justly angered President,
it appears, thought of founding a new party, an
American Party, "a constitutionalist party."<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> It
was said that the astute Jefferson so played upon
him that Adams came to think the engaging but
crafty Virginian aspired only to be and to be known
as the first lieutenant of the Massachusetts statesman.<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a>
Adams concluded that he could make up any
Federalist loss at the polls by courting the Republicans,
whose "friendship," wrote Ames, "he seeks for
himself."<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a></p>

<p>But the Republicans had almost recovered from
the effect of the X. Y. Z. disclosures. "The <i>rabies
canina</i> of Jacobinism has gradually spread ... from
the cities, where it was confined to docks and mob,
to the country,"<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> was the tidings of woe that Ames
sent to Gore. The Hamiltonian leaders despaired
of the continuance of the Government and saw "a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
convulsion of revolution" as the result of "excessive
democracy."<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> The union of all Federalist
votes was "the only measure by which the government
can be preserved."<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> But Federalist union!
As well ask shattered glass to remould itself!</p>

<p>The harmonious and disciplined Republicans were
superbly led. Jefferson combined their battle-cries
of the last two years into one mighty appeal&mdash;simple,
affirmative, popular. Peace, economy, "freedom
of the press, freedom of religion, trial by jury, ... no
standing armies," were the issues he announced, together
with the supreme issue of all, States' Rights.
Upon this latter doctrine Jefferson planted all the
Republican guns and directed their fire on "centralization"
which, said he, would "monarchise"
our Government and make it "the most corrupt on
earth," with increased "stock-jobbing, speculating,
plundering, office-holding, and office-hunting."<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a></p>

<p>The Federalists could reply but feebly. The tax-gatherer's
fingers were in every man's pockets; and
Adams had pardoned the men who had resisted the
collectors of tribute. The increased revenue was
required for the army and navy, which, thought the
people, were worse than needless<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> if there were to
be no war and the President's second mission made
hostilities improbable (they had forgotten that this
very preparation had been the principal means of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
changing the haughty attitude of France). The Alien
and Sedition Laws had infuriated the "foreign" voters<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>
and alarmed thousands of American-born citizens.
Even that potent bribe of free institutions, the
expectation of office, could no longer be employed
effectively with the party workers, who, testifies
Ebenezer Huntington, were going over "to Jefferson
in hopes to partake of the loaves and fishes, which
are to be distributed by the new President."<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a></p>

<p>The Federalist leaders did nothing, therefore, but
write letters to one another denouncing the "Jacobins"
and prophesying "anarchy." "Behold France&mdash;what
is theory here is fact there."<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> Even the
tractable McHenry was disgusted with his stronger
associates. "Their conduct," said he, "is tremulous,
timid, feeble, deceptive &amp; cowardly. They write
private letters. To whom? To each other. But they
do nothing.... If the party recover its pristine
energy &amp; splendor, shall I ascribe it to such cunning,
paltry, indecisive, backdoor conduct?"<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span></p>

<p>What had become of the French mission?<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> Would
to God it might fail! That outcome might yet save
the Federalist fortunes. "If Mr. Marshall has any
[news of the second French mission] beg him to let it
out," implored Chauncey Goodrich.<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> But Marshall
had none for public inspection. The envoys' dispatches
of May 17,<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> which had reached him nearly
seven weeks afterward, were perplexing. Indeed,
Marshall was "much inclined to think that ... the
French government may be inclined to protract it
[the negotiation] in the expectation that events in
America<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> may place them on higher ground than
that which they now occupy."<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> To Hamilton, he
cautiously wrote that the dispatches contained
nothing "on which a positive opinion respecting the
result of that negotiation can be formed."<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a></p>

<p>But he told the President that he feared "the impression
which will probably be made by the New
York Election,"<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> and that European military developments
might defeat the mission's purpose. He
advised Adams to consider what then should be
done. Should "hostilities against France with the
exception of their West India privateers ... be continued
if on their part a change of conduct shall be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>manifest?"<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> Adams was so perturbed that he asked
Marshall whether, in case the envoys returned
without a treaty, Congress ought not to be asked to
declare war, which already it had done in effect. For,
said Adams, "the public mind cannot be held in
a state of suspense; public opinion must be always a
decided one whether right or not."<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a></p>

<p>Marshall counseled patience and moderation. Indeed,
he finally informed Adams that he hoped for
an adjustment: "I am greatly disposed to think," he
advised the President, "that the present [French]
government is much inclined to correct, at least in
part, the follies of the past. Of these, none were
perhaps more conspicuous or more injurious to the
french nation, than their haughty and hostile conduct
to neutrals. Considerable retrograde steps in
this respect have already been taken, and I expect
the same course will be continued." If so, "there will
exist no cause for war, but to obtain compensation
for past injuries"; and this, Marshall is persuaded,
is not "a sufficient motive" for war.<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a></p>

<p>To others, however, Marshall was apprehensive:
"It is probable that their [the French] late victories
and the hope which many of our papers [Republican]
are well calculated to inspire, that America is disposed
once more to crouch at her [France's] feet may
render ineffectual our endeavors to obtain peace."<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span></p>
<p>But the second American mission to France had
dealt with Bonaparte himself, who was now First
Consul. The man on horseback had arrived, as
Marshall had foreseen; a statesman as well as a soldier
was now the supreme power in France. Also, as
we have seen, the American Government had provided
for an army and was building a navy which,
indeed, was even then attacking and defeating
French ships. "America in arms was treated with
some respect," as Marshall expresses it.<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> At any
rate, the American envoys did not have to overcome
the obstacles that lay in the way two years earlier
and the negotiations began without difficulty and
proceeded without friction.</p>

<p>Finally a treaty was made and copies sent to
Marshall, October 4, 1800.<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> The Republicans were
rejoiced; the Federalist politicians chagrined.<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> Hamilton
felt that in "the general politics of the world"
it "is a make-weight in the wrong scale," but he
favored its ratification because "the contrary ...
would ... utterly ruin the federal party," and
"moreover it is better to close the thing where it is
than to leave it to a Jacobin to do much worse."<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a></p>

<p>Marshall also advised ratification, although he
was "far, very far, from approving"<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> the treaty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
The Federalists in the Senate, however, were resolved
not to ratify it; they were willing to approve
only with impossible amendments. They could not
learn the President's opinion of this course; as to
that, even Marshall was in the dark. "The Secretary
of State knows as little of the intentions of the
President as any other person connected with the
government."<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> Finally the Senate rejected the convention;
but it was so "extremely popular," said
the Republicans, that the Federalist Senators were
"frightened" to "recant."<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> They reversed their
action and approved the compact. The strongest
influence to change their attitude, however, was
not the popularity of the treaty, but the pressure of
the mercantile interests which wanted the business-destroying
conflict settled.<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a></p>

<p>The Hamiltonian group daily became more wrathful
with the President. In addition to what they
considered his mistakes of policy and party blunders,
Adams's charge that they were a "British faction"
angered them more and more as the circulation of
it spread and the public credited it. Even "General<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
M[arshall] said that the hardest thing for the Federalists
to bear was the charge of British influence."<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a>
That was just what the "Jacobins" had been saying
all along.<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> "If this cannot be counteracted, our characters
are the sacrifice," wrote Hamilton in anger
and despair.<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> Adams's adherents were quite as
vengeful against his party enemies. The rank and
file of the Federalists were more and more disgusted
with the quarrels of the party leaders. "I cannot
describe ... how broken and scattered your federal
friends are!" lamented Troup. "We have no rallying-point;
and no mortal can divine where and when
we shall again collect our strength.... Shadows,
clouds, and darkness rest on our future prospects."<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a>
The "Aurora" chronicles that "the disorganized
state of the anti-Republican [Federalist] party ... is
scarcely describable."<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a></p>

<p>Marshall, alone, was trusted by all; a faith which
deepened, as we shall see, during the perplexing
months that follow. He strove for Federalist union,
but without avail. Even the most savage of the
President's party enemies felt that "there is not a
man in the U. S. of better intentions [than Marshall]
and he has the confidence of all good men&mdash;no man
regrets more than he does the disunion which has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
taken place and no one would do more to heal the
wounds inflicted by it. In a letter ... he says
'by union we can securely maintain our ground&mdash;without
it we must sink &amp; with us all sound correct
American principle.' His efforts will ... prove
ineffectual."<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a></p>

<p>It seems certain, then, that Hamilton did not consult
the one strong man in his party who kept his
head in this hour of anger-induced madness. Yet, if
ever any man needed the advice of a cool, far-seeing
mind, lighted by a sincere and friendly heart, Hamilton
required it then. And Marshall could and
would have given it. But the New York Federalist
chieftain conferred only with those who were as
blinded by hate as he was himself. At last, in the
midst of an absurd and pathetic confusion of counsels,<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a>
Hamilton decided to attack the President, and,
in October, wrote his fateful and fatal tirade against
Adams.<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> It was an extravaganza of party folly. It
denounced Adams's "extreme egotism," "terrible
jealousy," "eccentric tendencies," "violent rage";<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
and questioned "the solidity of his understanding."
Hamilton's screed went back to the Revolution to
discover faults in the President. Every act of his
Administration was arraigned as a foolish or wicked
mistake.</p>

<p>This stupid pamphlet was not to be made public,
but to be circulated privately among the Federalist
leaders in the various States. The watchful Burr
secured a copy<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> and published broadcast its bitterest
passages. The Republican politicians shook with
laughter; the Republican masses roared with glee.<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a>
The rank and file of the Federalists were dazed,
stunned, angered; the party leaders were in despair.
Thus exposed, Hamilton made public his whole
pamphlet. Although its purpose was to further the
plan to secure for Pinckney more votes than would
be given Adams, it ended with the apparent advice
to support both. Absurd conclusion! There might
be intellects profound enough to understand why it
was necessary to show that Adams was not fit to be
President and yet that he should be voted for; but
the mind of the average citizen could not fathom
such ratiocination. Hamilton's influence was irreparably
impaired.<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> The "Washington Federalist"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
denounced his attack as "the production of a disappointed
man" and declared that Adams was "much
his superior as a statesman."<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a></p>

<p>The campaign was a havoc of virulence. The Federalists'
hatred for one another increased their fury
toward the compact Republicans, who assailed their
quarreling foes with a savage and unrestrained ferocity.
The newspapers, whose excesses had whipped
even the placid Franklin into a rage a few years
before, now became geysers spouting slander, vituperation,
and unsavory<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> insinuations. "The venal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>

harmonious Republicans resorted to shameful methods.<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a>
"Never ... was there such an Election in
America."<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a></p>

<p>As autumn was painting the New England trees,
Adams, still tarrying at his Massachusetts home,
wrote Marshall to give his "sentiments as soon
as possible in writing" as to what the President
should say to Congress when it met December 3.<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a>
Three days later, when his first request was not yet
halfway to Washington, Adams, apparently forgetful
of his first letter, again urged Marshall to advise
him as President in regard to his forthcoming farewell
address to the National Legislature.<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a></p>

<span class="caption"><i>Statue of John Marshall<br />
<small>By W. W. Story, at the Capitol, Washington, D. C.</small></i></span>
</div>

<p>Marshall not only favored the President with his
"sentiments"&mdash;he wrote every word of the speech
which Adams delivered to Congress and sent it to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>the distressed Chief Magistrate in such haste that he
did not even make a copy.<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> This presidential address,
the first ever made to Congress in Washington,
was delivered exactly as Marshall wrote it, with a
change of only one word "much" for "such" and the
omission of an adjective "great."<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a></p>

<p>The address is strong on the necessity for military
and naval preparation. It would be "a dangerous
imprudence to abandon those measures of self-protection ... to which ... violence and the injustice
of others may again compel us to resort....
Seasonable and systematic arrangements ... for a
defensive war" are "a wise and true economy." The
navy is described as particularly important, coast
defenses are urged, and the manufacture of domestic
arms is recommended in order to "supercede the
necessity of future importations." The extension
of the national Judiciary is pressed as of "primary
importance ... to the public happiness."<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a></p>

<p>The election, at last, was over. The Republicans
won, but only by a dangerously narrow margin.
Indeed, outside of New York, the Federalists secured
more electoral votes in 1800 than in the election of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
Adams four years earlier.<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> The great constructive
work of the Federalist Party still so impressed conservative
people; the mercantile and financial interests
were still so well banded together; the Federalist
revival of 1798, brought about by Marshall's dispatches,
was, as yet, so strong; the genuine worth of
Adams's statesmanship<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> was so generally recognized
in spite of his unhappy manner, that it would
seem as though the Federalists might have succeeded
but for the quarrels of their leaders and Burr's skillful
conduct of the Republican campaign in New
York.</p>

<p>Jefferson and Burr each had seventy-three votes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
for President. Under the Constitution, as it stood
at that time, the final choice for President was thus
thrown into the House of Representatives.<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> By united
and persistent effort, it was possible for the Federalists
to elect Burr, or at least prevent any choice and,
by law, give the Presidency to one of their own number
until the next election. This, Jefferson advises
Burr, "they are strong enough to do."<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> The Federalists
saw their chance; the Republicans realized their
danger.<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> Jefferson writes of the "great dismay and
gloom on the republican gentlemen here and equal
exultation on the federalists who openly declare they
will prevent an election."<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> This "opens upon us an
abyss, at which every sincere patriot must shudder."<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a></p>

<p>Although Hamilton hated Burr venomously, he
advised the Federalist managers in Washington "to
throw out a lure for him, in order to tempt him to
start for the plate, and then lay the foundation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
dissension between" him and Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> The Federalists,
however, already were turning to Burr, not
according to Hamilton's unworthy suggestion, but
in deadly earnest. At news of this, the fast-weakening
New York Federalist chieftain became frantic.
He showered letters upon the party leaders in Congress,
and upon all who might have influence, appealing,
arguing, persuading, threatening.<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a></p>

<p>But the Federalists in Congress were not to be
influenced, even by the once omnipotent Hamilton.
"The Federalists, almost with one Mind, from every
Quarter of the Union, say elect Burr" because "they
must be disgraced in the Estimation of the People if
they vote for Jefferson having told Them that He
was a Man without Religion, the Writer of the Letter
to Mazzei, a Coward, &amp;c., &amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> Hamilton's fierce
warnings against Burr and his black prophecies of
"the <i>Cataline</i> of America"<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> did not frighten them.
They knew little of Burr, personally, and the coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>try
knew less. What was popularly known of this
extraordinary man was not unattractive to the
Federalists.</p>

<p>Burr was the son of the President of Princeton and
the grandson of the celebrated Jonathan Edwards,
the greatest theologian America had produced. He
had been an intrepid and efficient officer in the Revolutionary
War, and an able and brilliant Senator of
the United States. He was an excellent lawyer and
a well-educated, polished man of the world. He was
a politician of energy, resourcefulness, and decision.
And he was a practical man of affairs. If he were
elected by Federalist votes, the fury with which Jefferson
and his friends were certain to assail Burr<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a>
would drive that practical politician openly into
their camp; and, as President, he would bring with
him a considerable Republican following. Thus the
Federalists would be united and strengthened and
the Republicans divided and weakened.<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a></p>

<p>This was the reasoning which drew and bound the
Federalists together in their last historic folly; and
they felt that they might succeed. "It is ... certainly
within the compass of possibility that Burr<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
may ultimately obtain nine States," writes Bayard.<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a>
In addition to the solid Federalist strength in the
House, there were at least three Republican members,
two corrupt and the other light-minded, who
might by "management" be secured for Burr.<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> The
Federalist managers felt that "the high Destinies ... of this United &amp; enlightened people are up";<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a>
and resolved upon the hazard. Thus the election of
Burr, or, at least, a deadlock, faced the Republican
chieftain.</p>

<p>At this critical hour there was just one man who
still had the confidence of all Federalists from Adams
to Hamilton. John Marshall, Secretary of State,
had enough influence to turn the scales of Federalist
action. Hamilton approached Marshall indirectly
at first. "You may communicate this letter to
<i>Marshall</i>," he instructed Wolcott, in one of his most
savage denunciations of Burr.<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> Wolcott obeyed
and reported that Marshall "has yet expressed no
opinion."<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> Thereupon Hamilton wrote Marshall
personally.</p>

<p>This letter is lost; but undoubtedly it was in the
same vein as were those to Wolcott, Bayard, Sedgwick,
Morris, and other Federalists. But Hamilton
could not persuade Marshall to throw his influence
to Jefferson. The most Marshall would do was to
agree to keep hands off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span></p>

<p>"To Mr. Jefferson," replies Marshall, "whose
political character is better known than that of Mr.
Burr, I have felt almost insuperable objections. His
foreign prejudices seem to me totally to unfit him for
the chief magistracy of a nation which cannot indulge
those prejudices without sustaining deep and
permanent injury.</p>

<p>"In addition to this solid and immovable objection,
Mr. Jefferson appears to me to be a man, who
will embody himself with the House of Representatives.<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a>
By weakening the office of President, he will
increase his personal power. He will diminish his
responsibility, sap the fundamental principles of the
government, and become the leader of that party
which is about to constitute the majority of the
legislature. The morals of the author of the letter
to Mazzei<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> cannot be pure....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your representation of Mr. Burr, with whom I
am totally unacquainted, shows that from him still
greater danger than even from Mr. Jefferson may be
apprehended. Such a man as you describe is more
to be feared, and may do more immediate, if not
greater mischief.</p>

<p>"Believing that you know him well, and are impartial,
my preference would certainly not be for
him, but I can take no part in this business. I cannot
bring myself to aid Mr. Jefferson. Perhaps
respect for myself should, in my present situation,
deter me from using any influence (if, indeed I possessed
any) in support of either gentleman.</p>

<p>"Although no consideration could induce me to be
the Secretary of State while there was a President
whose political system I believed to be at variance
with my own; yet this cannot be so well known to
others, and it might be suspected that a desire to be
well with the successful candidate had, in some degree,
governed my conduct."<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a></p>

<p>Marshall had good personal reasons for wishing
Burr to be elected, or at least that a deadlock should
be produced. He did not dream that the Chief Justiceship
was to be offered to him; his law practice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
neglected for three years, had passed into other
hands; the head of the Cabinet was then the most
important<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> office in the Government, excepting only
the Presidency itself; and rumor had it that Marshall
would remain Secretary of State in case Burr was
chosen as Chief Magistrate. If the tie between Jefferson
and Burr were not broken, Marshall might
even be chosen President.<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a></p>

<p>"I am rather inclined to think that Mr. Burr will
be preferred.... General Marshall will then remain
in the department of state; but if Mr. Jefferson be
chosen, Mr. Marshall will retire," writes Pickering.<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a>
But if Marshall cherished the ambition to continue
as Secretary of State, as seems likely, he finally
stifled it and stood aloof from the struggle. It was
a decision which changed Marshall's whole life and
affected the future of the Republic. Had Marshall
openly worked for Burr, or even insisted upon a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
permanent deadlock, it is reasonably certain that
the Federalists would have achieved one of their
alternate purposes.</p>

<p>Although Marshall refrained from assisting the
Federalists in their plan to elect Burr, he did not
oppose it. The "Washington Federalist," which
was the Administration organ<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> in the Capital,
presented in glowing terms the superior qualifications
of Burr over Jefferson for the Presidency,
three weeks after Marshall's letter to Hamilton.<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
The Republicans said that Marshall wrote much
that appeared in this newspaper.<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> If he was influential
with the editor, he did not exercise his power
to exclude the paper's laudation of the New York
Republican leader.</p>

<p>It was reported that Marshall had declared that,
in case of a deadlock, Congress "may appoint a
Presidt. till another election is made."<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> The rumor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
increased Republican alarm and fanned Republican
anger. From Richmond came the first tidings of the
spirit of popular resistance to "such a usurpation,"<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a>
even though it might result in the election of Marshall
himself to the Presidency. If they could not
elect Burr, said Jefferson, the Federalists planned
to make Marshall or Jay the Chief Executive by a
law to be passed by the expiring Federalist Congress.<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a></p>

<p>Monroe's son-in-law, George Hay, under the <i>nom
de guerre</i> of "Hortensius," attacked Marshall in
an open letter in the "Richmond Examiner," which
was copied far and wide in the Republican press.
Whether Congress will act on Marshall's opinion,
says Hay, "is a question which has already diffused
throughout America anxiety and alarm; a question
on the decision of which depends not only the peace
of the nation, but the existence of the Union." Hay
recounts the many indications of the Federalists' purpose
and says: "I understand that you, Sir, have not
only examined the Constitution, but have given an
opinion in exact conformity with the wishes of your
party." He challenges Marshall to "come forward ...
and defend it." If a majority of the House choose
Burr the people will submit, says Hay, because
such an election, though contrary to their wishes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
would be constitutional. But if, disregarding the
popular will and also violating the Constitution,
Congress "shall elect a stranger to rule over us,
peace and union are driven from the land.... The
usurpation ... will be instantly and firmly repelled.
The government will be at an end."<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a></p>

<p>Although the "Washington Federalist" denounced
as "a lie"<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> the opinion attributed to him,
Marshall, personally, paid no attention to this bold
and menacing challenge. But Jefferson did. After
waiting a sufficient time to make sure that this open
threat of armed revolt expressed the feeling of the
country, he asserted that "we thought best to declare
openly and firmly, one &amp; all, that the day such an
act passed, the Middle States would arm, &amp; that no
such usurpation, even for a single day, should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
submitted to."<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> The Republicans determined not
only to resist the "usurpation ... by arms," but
to set aside the Constitution entirely and call "a convention
to reorganize and amend the government."<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a></p>

<p>The drums of civil war were beating. Between
Washington and Richmond "a chain of expresses"
was established, the messengers riding "day and
night."<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> In Maryland and elsewhere, armed men,
wrought up to the point of bloodshed, made ready
to march on the rude Capital, sprawling among the
Potomac hills and thickets. Threats were openly
made that any man appointed President by act of
Congress, pursuant to Marshall's reputed opinion,
would be instantly assassinated. The Governor of
Pennsylvania prepared to lead the militia into
Washington by the 3d of March.<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a></p>

<p>To this militant attitude Jefferson ascribed the
final decision of the Federalists to permit his election.
But no evidence exists that they were intimidated
in the least, or in any manner influenced, by
the ravings of Jefferson's adherents. On the contrary,
the Federalists defied and denounced the Republicans
and met their threats of armed interference
with declarations that they, too, would resort to
the sword.<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span></p>

<p>The proof is overwhelming and decisive that
nothing but Burr's refusal to help the Federalists in
his own behalf,<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> his rejection of their proposals,<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
his determination, if chosen, to go in as a Republican
untainted by any promises;<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> and, on the other
hand, the assurances which Jefferson gave Federalists
as to offices and the principal Federalist policies&mdash;Neutrality,
the Finances, and the Navy<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a>&mdash;only
all of these circumstances combined finally made
Jefferson president. Indeed, so stubborn was the
opposition that, in spite of his bargain with the
Federalists and Burr's repulsion of their advances,
nearly all of them, through the long and thrillingly
dramatic days and nights of balloting,<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> with the
menace of physical violence hanging over them,
voted against Jefferson and for Burr to the very end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span></p>

<p>The terms concluded with Jefferson, enough
Federalists cast blank ballots<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> to permit his election;
and so the curtain dropped on this comedy of
shame.<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> "Thus has ended the most wicked and
absurd attempt ever tried by the Federalists," said
the innocent Gallatin.<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> So it came about that the
party of Washington, as a dominant and governing
force in the development of the American Nation,
went down forever in a welter of passion, tawdry
politics, and disgraceful intrigue. All was lost,
including honor.</p>

<p>But no! All was not lost. The Judiciary remained.
The newly elected House and President were Republican
and in two years the Senate also would be
"Jacobin"; but no Republican was as yet a member
of the National Judiciary. Let that branch of the
Government be extended; let new judgeships be
created, and let new judges be made while Federalists
could be appointed and confirmed, so that, by
means, at least, of the National Courts, States' Rights
might be opposed and retarded, and Nationalism
defended and advanced&mdash;thus ran the thoughts
and the plans of the Federalist leaders.</p>

<p>Adams, in the speech to Congress in December of
the previous year, had urged the enactment of a law
to this end as "indispensably necessary."<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
President's address to the expiring Federalist Congress
on December 3, 1800, which Marshall wrote,
the extension of the National Judiciary, as we have
seen, was again insistently urged.<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> Upon that measure,
at least, Adams and all Federalists agreed.
"Permit me," wrote General Gunn to Hamilton, "to
offer for your consideration, the policy of the federal
party <i>extending the influence of our judiciary</i>; if
neglected by the federalists the ground will be occupied
by the enemy, the very next session of Congress,
and, sir, we shall see &mdash;&mdash; and many other scoundrels
placed on the seat of justice."<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, extension of the National Judiciary was
now the most cherished purpose of Federalism.<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> A
year earlier, after Adams's first recommendation of
it, Wolcott narrates that "the steady men" in the
Senate and House were bent upon it, because "there
is no other way to combat the state opposition [to
National action] but by an efficient and extended
organization of judges."<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a></p>

<p>Two weeks after Congress convened, Roger Griswold
of Connecticut reported the eventful bill to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
carry out this Federalist plan.<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> It was carefully and
ably drawn and greatly widened the practical effectiveness
of the National Courts. The Supreme
Court was reduced, after the next vacancy, to five
members&mdash;to prevent, said the Republicans, the
appointment of one of their party to the Nation's
highest tribunal.<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> Many new judgeships were created.
The Justices of the Supreme Court, who had
sat as circuit judges, were relieved of this itinerant
labor and three circuit judges for each circuit were
to assume these duties. At first, even the watchful
and suspicious Jefferson thought that "the judiciary
system will not be pushed, as the appointments,
if made, by the present administration,
could not fall on those who create them."<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jefferson underestimated the determination
of the Federalists. Because they felt that the bill
would "greatly extend the judiciary power and of
course widen the basis of government," they were
resolved, writes Rutledge, to "profit of our shortlived
majority, and do as much good as we can
before the end of this session"<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> by passing the
Judiciary Bill.</p>

<p>In a single week Jefferson changed from confidence
to alarm. After all, he reflected, Adams could
fill the new judgeships, and these were life appointments.
"I dread this above all the measures meditated,
because appointments in the nature of freehold
render it difficult to undo what is done,"<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> was
Jefferson's second thought.</p>

<p>The Republicans fought the measure, though not
with the vigor or animosity justified by the political
importance they afterwards attached to it. Among
the many new districts created was an additional
one in Virginia. The representatives from that State
dissented; but, in the terms of that period, even their
opposition was not strenuous. They said that, in
Virginia, litigation was declining instead of increasing.
"At the last term the docket was so completely
cleared in ... ten days ... that the court ... had
actually decided on several [suits] returnable to the
ensuing term."<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a></p>

<p>That, replied the Federalists, was because the
courts were too far away from the citizens. As for
the National revenues, they could be collected only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
through National tribunals; for this purpose,<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> two
Federal Courts in Virginia, as provided by the bill,
were essential. But, of course, sneered the Federalists,
"Virginia would be well satisfied with one court
in preference to two or with no court whatever in
preference to one."<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a></p>

<p>But there was a defect in the bill, intimated the
Virginia Republicans, that affected tenants and
landowners of the Northern Neck. A clause of section
thirteen gave the newly established National
Court jurisdiction of all causes arising under the
Constitution where original or exclusive jurisdiction
was not conferred upon the Supreme Court or
Admiralty Courts.<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> The National Court of the new
Virginia District was to be held at Fredericksburg.
Thus all suits for quitrents or other claims against
those holding their lands under the Fairfax title
could be brought in this near-by National Court,
instead of in State Courts. This criticism was so
attenuated and so plainly based on the assumption
that the State Courts would not observe the law in
such actions, that it was not pressed with ardor even
by the impetuous and vindictive Giles.</p>

<p>But Nicholas went so far as to move that the jurisdiction
of National Courts should be limited to causes
exceeding five hundred dollars. This would cut out
the great mass of claims which the present holders of
the Fairfax title might lawfully have against tenants
or owners. The Marshalls were the Fairfax assign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>ees,
as we have seen. No Republican, however,
mentioned them in debate; but some one procured
the insertion in the record of an insinuation which
nobody made on the floor. In brackets, the "Annals,"
after the brief note of Nicholas's objection,
states: "[It is understood that the present assignees
of the claims of Lord Fairfax, are General
Marshall, General Lee, and a third individual and
that they maintain their claims under the British
Treaty.]"<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a></p>

<p>For three weeks the debate in the House dragged
along. Republican opposition, though united, was
languid.<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> At last, without much Republican resistance,
the bill passed the House on January 20, 1801,
and reached the Senate the next day.<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> Two weeks
later the Senate Republicans moved a substitute
providing for fewer circuits, fewer judges, and a
larger Supreme Court, the members of which were
to act as circuit judges as formerly.<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> It was defeated
by a vote of 17 to 13.<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> The next day the bill was
passed by a vote of 16 to 11.<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a></p>

<p>When the debate began, the National Judiciary
was without a head. Ellsworth, broken in health,
had resigned. Adams turned to Jay, the first Chief
Justice, and, without asking his consent, reappointed
him. "I have nominated you to your old station,"<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
wrote the President. "This is as independent of the
inconstancy of the people, as it is of the will of a
President." But Jay declined.<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> Some of the Federalist
leaders were disgruntled at Jay's appointment.
"Either Judge Paterson [of New Jersey] or General
Pinckney ought to have been appointed; but both
these worthies were your friends,"<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> Gunn reported
to Hamilton. The Republicans were relieved by
Jay's nomination&mdash;they "were afraid of something
worse."<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a></p>

<p>Then, on January 20, 1801, with no herald announcing
the event, no trumpet sounding, suddenly,
and without previous notification even to himself,
John Marshall was nominated as Chief Justice of
the United States a few weeks before the Federalists
went out of power forever. His appointment
was totally unexpected. It was generally thought
that Judge Paterson was the logical successor to
Ellsworth.<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> Marshall, indeed, had recommended his
selection.<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> The letters of the Federalist leaders, who
at this period were lynx-eyed for any office, do not
so much as mention Marshall's name in connection
with the position of Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Doubtless the President's choice of Marshall was
influenced by the fact that his "new minister,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
Marshall, did all to" his "entire satisfaction."<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> Federalist
politicians afterward caviled at this statement
of Adams. It was quite the other way around,
they declared. "Every one who knew that great
man [Marshall] knew that he possessed to an extraordinary
degree the faculty of putting his own
ideas into the minds of others, unconsciously to
them. The secret of Mr. Adams's satisfaction [with
Marshall] was, that he obeyed his Secretary of State
without suspecting it."<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a></p>

<p>The President gave Marshall's qualifications as
the reason of his elevation. Boudinot reported to
Adams that the New Jersey bar hailed with "the
greatest pleasure" a rumor that "the office of Chief
Justice ... may be filled by" Adams himself "after
the month of March next." The President, who admitted
that he was flattered, answered: "I have already,
by the nomination of a gentleman in the full
vigor of middle age, in the full habits of business, and
whose reading of the science is fresh in his head,<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> to
this office, put it wholly out of my power as it never
was in my hopes or wishes."<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's appointment as Chief Justice was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
greeted with applause from any quarter; there was
even a hint of Federalist resentment because Paterson
had not been chosen. "I see it denied in your
paper that Mr. Marshall was nominated Chief Justice
of the U.S. The fact is so and he will without
doubt have the concurrence of the Senate, tho' some
hesitation was at first expressed from respect for the
pretensions of Mr. Paterson."<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> The Republican
politicians were utterly indifferent; and the masses
of both parties neither knew nor cared about Marshall's
elevation.</p>

<p>The Republican press, of course, criticized the
appointment, as it felt bound to attack any and
every thing, good or bad, that the Federalists did.
But its protests against Marshall were so mild
that, in view of the recklessness of the period, this
was a notable compliment. "The vacant Chief Justiceship
is to be conferred on John Marshall, one
time General, afterwards ambassador to X. Y. and
Z., and for a short time incumbent of the office of
Secretary of State.... Who is to receive the salary
of the Secretary of State, after Mr. Marshall's
resignation, we cannot foretell, because the wisdom
of our wise men surpasseth understanding."<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a>
Some days later the "Aurora," in a long article,
denounced the Judiciary Law as a device for furnishing
defeated Federalist politicians with offices,<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
and declared that the act would never be "carried
into execution, ... unless" the Federalists still
meant to usurp the Presidency. But it goes on
to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We cannot permit ourselves to believe that <i>John
Marshall</i> has been called to the bench to foster such
a plot.... Still, how can we account for the strange
mutations which have passed before us&mdash;Marshall
for a few weeks Secretary of State ascends the bench
of the Chief Justice."<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> The principal objection of
the Republican newspapers to Marshall, however,
was that he, "before he left the office [of Secretary of
State], made provision for all the Federal printers to
the extent of his power.... He employed the <i>aristocratic
presses alone</i> to publish laws ... for ... one
year."<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a></p>

<p>Only the dissipated and venomous Callender, from
his cell in prison, displayed that virulent hatred of
Marshall with which an increasing number of Jefferson's
followers were now obsessed. "We are to have
that precious acquisition John Marshall as Chief
Justice.... The very sound of this man's name is
an insult upon truth and justice"; and the dissolute
scribbler then pours the contents of his ink-pot
over Marshall's X. Y. Z. dispatches, bespatters his
campaign for election to Congress, and continues
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"John Adams first appointed John Jay in the
room of Ellsworth. A strong suspicion exists that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
John did this with the previous certainty that John
Jay would refuse the nomination. It was then in
view to name John Marshall: first, because President
Jefferson will not be able to turn him out of office,
unless by impeachment; and in the second place that
the faction [Federalist Party] who burnt the war
office might, with better grace, attempt, forsooth, to
set him up as a sort of president himself. <i>Sus ad
Minervam!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a></p>

<p>That the voice of this depraved man, so soon to be
turned against his patron Jefferson, who had not yet
cast him off, was the only one raised against Marshall's
appointment to the highest judicial office in
the Nation, is a striking tribute, when we consider
the extreme partisanship and unrestrained abuse
common to the times.</p>

<p>Marshall himself, it appears, was none too eager
to accept the position which Ellsworth had resigned
and Jay refused; the Senate delayed the confirmation
of his nomination;<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> and it was not until the
last day of the month that his commission was
executed.</p>

<p>On January 31, 1801, the President directed Dexter
"to execute the office of Secretary of State so
far as to affix the seal of the United States to the
inclosed commission to the present Secretary of
State, John Marshall, of Virginia, to be Chief Justice
of the United States, and to certify in your own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
name on the commission as executing the office of
Secretary of State <i>pro hac vice</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a></p>

<p>It was almost a week before Marshall formally
acknowledged and accepted the appointment. "I
pray you to accept my grateful acknowledgments for
the honor conferred on me in appointing me Chief
Justice of the United States. This additional and
flattering mark of your good opinion has made an
impression on my mind which time will not efface.
I shall enter immediately on the duties of the office,
and hope never to give you occasion to regret
having made this appointment."<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a> Marshall's acceptance
greatly relieved the President, who instantly
acknowledged his letter: "I have this
moment received your letter of this morning,
and am happy in your acceptance of the office of
Chief Justice."<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a></p>

<p>Who should be Secretary of State for the remaining
fateful four weeks? Adams could think of no one
but Marshall, who still held that office although he
had been appointed, confirmed, and commissioned
as Chief Justice. Therefore, wrote Adams, "the
circumstances of the times ... render it necessary
that I should request and authorize you, as I do by
this letter, to continue to discharge all the duties
of Secretary of State until ulterior arrangements
can be made."<a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a></p>

<p>Thus Marshall was at the same time Chief Jus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>tice
of the Supreme Court and Secretary of State.
Thus for the second time these two highest appointive
offices of the National Government were held
simultaneously by the same man.<a name="FNanchor_1328_1328" id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> He drew but one
salary, of course, during this period, that of Chief
Justice,<a name="FNanchor_1329_1329" id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> the salary of Secretary of State remaining
unpaid.</p>

<p>The President rapidly filled the newly created
places on the Federal Bench. Marshall, it appears,
was influential in deciding these appointments. "I
wrote for you to Dexter, requesting him to show it
to Marshall,"<a name="FNanchor_1330_1330" id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a> was Ames's reassuring message to
an aspirant to the Federal Bench. With astounding
magnanimity or blindness, Adams bestowed one of
these judicial positions upon Wolcott, and Marshall
"transmits ... the commission ... with peculiar
pleasure. Permit me," he adds, "to express my
sincere wish that it may be acceptable to you." His
anxiety to make peace between Adams and Wolcott
suggests that he induced the President to make this
appointment. For, says Marshall, "I will allow
myself the hope that this high and public evidence,
given by the President, of his respect for your services
and character, will efface every unpleasant sensation
respecting the past, and smooth the way to a
perfect reconciliation."<a name="FNanchor_1331_1331" id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span></p>

<p>Wolcott "cordially thanks" Marshall for "the
obliging expressions of" his "friendship." He accepts
the office "with sentiments of gratitude and
good will," and agrees to Marshall's wish for reconciliation
with Adams, "not only without reluctance
or reserve but with the highest satisfaction."<a name="FNanchor_1332_1332" id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a> Thus
did Marshall end one of the feuds which so embarrassed
the Administration of John Adams.<a name="FNanchor_1333_1333" id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a></p>

<p>Until nine o'clock<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> of the night before Jefferson's
inauguration, Adams continued to nominate officers,
including judges, and the Senate to confirm them.
Marshall, as Secretary of State, signed and sealed the
commissions. Although Adams was legally within
his rights, the only moral excuse for his conduct
was that, if it was delayed, Jefferson would make the
appointments, control the National Judiciary, and
through it carry out his States' Rights doctrine
which the Federalists believed would dissolve the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
Union; if Adams acted, the most the Republicans
could do would be to oust his appointees by repealing
the law.<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a></p>

<p>The angry but victorious Republicans denounced
Adams's appointees as "midnight judges." It was
a catchy and clever phrase. It flew from tongue to
tongue, and, as it traveled, it gathered force and
volume. Soon a story grew up around the expression.
Levi Lincoln, the incoming Attorney-General,
it was said, went, Jefferson's watch in his hand,
to Marshall's room at midnight and found him
signing and sealing commissions. Pointing to the
timepiece, Lincoln told Marshall that, by the President's
watch, the 4th of March had come, and
bade him instantly lay down his nefarious pen;
covered with humiliation, Marshall rose from his
desk and departed.<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span></p>

<p>This tale is, probably, a myth. Jefferson never
spared an enemy, and Marshall was his especial
aversion. Yet in his letters denouncing these appointments,
while he savagely assails Adams, he does
not mention Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a> Jefferson's "Anas," inspired
by Marshall's "Life of Washington," omits no circumstance,
no rumor, no second, third, or fourth
hand tale that could reflect upon an enemy. Yet he
never once refers to the imaginary part played by
Marshall in the "midnight judges" legend.<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson asked Marshall to administer to him the
presidential oath of office on the following day. Considering
his curiously vindictive nature, it is unthinkable
that Jefferson would have done this had
he sent his newly appointed Attorney-General, at
the hour of midnight, to stop Marshall's consummation
of Adams's "indecent"<a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> plot.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the flush of victory and the multitude
of practical and weighty matters that immediately
claimed his entire attention, it is probable that Jefferson
never imagined that Marshall would prove to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
be anything more than the learned but gentle Jay
or the able but innocuous Ellsworth had been. Also,
as yet, the Supreme Court was, comparatively, powerless,
and the Republican President had little cause
to fear from it that stern and effective resistance to
his anti-national principles, which he was so soon to
experience. Nor did the Federalists themselves suspect
that the Virginia lawyer and politician would
reveal on the Supreme Bench the determination,
courage, and constructive genius which was presently
to endow that great tribunal with life and
strength and give to it the place it deserved in our
scheme of government.</p>

<p>In the opinions of those who thought they knew
him, both friend and foe, Marshall's character was
well understood. All were agreed as to his extraordinary
ability. No respectable person, even among
his enemies, questioned his uprightness. The charm
of his personality was admitted by everybody. But
no one had, as yet, been impressed by the fact that
commanding will and unyielding purpose were Marshall's
chief characteristics. His agreeable qualities
tended to conceal his masterfulness. Who could
discern in this kindly person, with "lax, lounging
manners," indolent, and fond of jokes, the heart
that dared all things? And all overlooked the influence
of Marshall's youth, his determinative army
life, his experience during the disintegrating years
after Independence was achieved and before the
Constitution was adopted, the effect of the French
Revolution on his naturally orderly mind, and the
part he had taken and the ineffaceable impressions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
necessarily made upon him by the tremendous
events of the first three Administrations of the
National Government.</p>

<p>Thus it was that, unobtrusively and in modest
guise, Marshall took that station which, as long as
he lived, he was to make the chief of all among the
high places in the Government of the American
Nation.</p>

the Barbary corsairs held the whole of Europe and America under
tribute for many years. Although our part in this general submission
to these brigands of the seas was shameful, America was the first
to move against them. One of Jefferson's earliest official letters after
becoming President was to the Bey of Tripoli, whom Jefferson addressed
as "Great and Respected Friend ... Illustrious &amp; honored ... whom
God preserve." Jefferson's letter ends with this fervent
invocation: "I pray God, very great and respected friend, to have
you always in his holy keeping." (Jefferson to Bey of Tripoli, May
21, 1801; <i>Am. St. Prs., For. Rel.</i>, ii, 349.)
</p><p>
And see Jefferson to Bey of Tunis (Sept. 9, 1801; <i>ib.</i>, 358), in which
the American President addresses this sea robber and holder of Americans
in slavery, as "Great and Good Friend" and apologizes for delay
in sending our tribute. In Jefferson's time, no notice was taken of such
expressions, which were recognized as mere forms. But ninety years
later the use of this exact expression, "Great and Good Friend," addressed
to the Queen of the Hawaiian Islands, was urged on the stump
and in the press against President Cleveland in his campaign for re-election.

with the Barbary pirates see Allen: <i>Our Navy and the Barbary
Corsairs</i>.</p></div>

during this period see Tench Coxe: <i>Examination of the Conduct of Great
Britain Respecting Neutrals</i>. Coxe declares that the purpose and policy
of Great Britain were to "monopolize the commerce of the world....
She denies the lawfulness of supplying and buying from her enemies,
and, in the face of the world, enacts statutes to enable her own
subjects to do these things. (<i>Ib.</i>, 62.) ... She now aims at the Monarchy
of the ocean.... Her trade is war.... The spoils of neutrals
fill her warehouses, while she incarcerates their bodies in her floating
castles. She seizes their persons and property as the rich fruit of
bloodless victories over her unarmed friends." (<i>Ib.</i>, 72.)

This was the accepted American view at the time Marshall wrote his
protest; and it continued to be such until the War of 1812. Coxe's book
is packed closely with citations and statistics sustaining his position.</p></div>

The public discussion of Adams's charge of a "British faction"
against his party enemies began with the publication of a foolish letter
he had written to Coxe, in May of 1792, insinuating that Pinckney's
appointment to the British Court had been secured by "much British
influence." (Adams to Coxe, May, 1792; Gibbs, ii, 424.) The President
gave vitality to the gossip by talking of the Hamiltonian Federalists
as a "British faction." He should have charged it publicly and
formally or else kept perfectly silent. He did neither, and thus
only enraged his foe within the party without getting the advantage
of an open and aggressive attack. (See Steiner, footnote 3, to 468.)</p></div>

was compensation for the immense spoliation of American commerce
by the French. The treaty not only failed to grant this, but provided
that we should restore the French ships captured by American vessels
during our two years' maritime war with France, which, though
formally undeclared, was vigorous and successful. "One part of the
treaty abandons all our rights, and the other part makes us the dupes
of France in the game she means to play against the maritime power
of England.... We lose our honor, by restoring the ships we have
taken, and by so doing, perhaps, make an implicit acknowledgment of
the injustice of our hostile operations." (Rutledge to Hamilton,

Some Federalist politicians, however, observed Hamilton's wishes.
For example: "You must at all events secure to the Genr. [Pinckney] a

on the accomplishment of this measure. You know a friend of ours
who can arrange this necessary business with the utmost perfect
suavity." (Dickinson to McHenry, Oct. 7, 1800; Steiner, 471.)

Again Dickinson writes of "the absolute necessity of obtaining a
<i>majority</i> (if it should only be by a <i>single</i> vote) in Cong. to favor the
man who interests us most" and hopes "Hamilton's publication ... will
produce the desired effect." (Oct. 31, 1800; <i>ib.</i>, 472.)</p></div>

Although it did not equal the extravagance of the Republican newspapers,
the Federalist press was also violent. See, for instance, a
satirical poem "by an Hibernian and an Alien" in the <i>Alexandria
Advertiser</i>, reprinted in the <i>Washington Federalist</i> of February 12,
1801, of which the last verse runs:&mdash;
</p><p class="poem">

Oh! how we'll squeeze the old Quakers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Philosophy is a fine thing</i>!"</span><br />
</p><p>
The familiar campaign arguments were, of course, incessantly
reiterated as: "The Government" cost only "<span class="smcap">five million</span>
dollars ... before the British treaty"; now it costs "<span class="smcap">fifteen millions</span>.

the <i>Washington Federalist</i> of Jan. 9, 1801, thus eulogized him:&mdash;
</p><p>
"The die is cast!... Our beloved <span class="smcap">Adams</span> will now close his bright
career.... Immortal sage! May thy counsels continue to be our
saving Angel! Retire and receive ... the ... blessings of all <i>good</i>
men....
</p><p>
"Sons of faction [party]! demagogues and high priests of anarchy,
now have you cause to triumph. Despots and tyrants! now may you
safely pronounce 'ingratitude is the common vice of all republics.
Envy and neglect are the only reward of superior merit. Calumny,
persecution and banishment are the laurels of the hoary patriot.'...
</p><p>
"... We have to contend ... for national existence. Magistrates
and rulers, be firm.... Our constitution is our last fortress. Let us
entrench it against every innovation. When this falls, our country is
lost forever."
</p><p>
This editorial, as well as all political matter appearing in the <i>Washington
Federalist</i> during 1800-01, is important because of Marshall's
reputed influence over that paper. (See <i>infra</i>, 541.)
</p><p>
At news of Jefferson's success the leading Federalist journal declared
that some Republicans in Philadelphia "huzzaed until they
were seized with lockjaw ... and three hundred are now drunk
beyond hope of recovery. Gin and whiskey are said to have risen
in price 50 per cent since nine o'clock this morning. The bells have
been ringing, guns firing, dogs barking, cats meuling, children crying,
and jacobins getting drunk, ever since the news of Mr. Jefferson's
election arrived in this city." (<i>Gazette of the United States</i>,
Feb. 19, 1801.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1244_1244" id="Footnote_1244_1244"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1244_1244"><span class="label">[1244]</span></a> At that time, the presidential electors did not vote for a Vice-President,
but only for President. The person receiving the largest
number of electoral votes became President and the one for whom
the second largest number of votes were cast became Vice-President.
When Jefferson and Burr each had seventy-three votes for President,
the election was thrown into the House of Representatives.
</p><p>
Thus, although, in casting their ballots for electors, the people really
voted for Jefferson for President and for Burr for Vice-President, the
equal number of votes received by each created a situation where it
was possible to defeat the will of the people. Indeed, as appears in the
text, that result was almost accomplished. It was this constitutional
defect that led to the Twelfth Amendment which places the election
of President and Vice-President on its present basis. (See "The Fifth
Wheel in our Government"; Beveridge: <i>Century Magazine</i>, December,
1909.)</p></div>

The <i>Washington Federalist</i>, even when the balloting was in progress,
thus stimulated the members of its party in the House: "<i>Unworthy</i>
will he be and consecrate his name to infamy, who ... has hitherto
opposed ... Mr. Jefferson ... and shall now meanly and inconsistently
lend his aid to promote it [Jefferson's election].... Will they
confer on Mr. Jefferson the Federal suffrage in reward for the calumnies
he has indiscriminately cast upon the Federal character; or
will they remunerate him ... for the very honorable epithets of
<i>pander, to the whore of England, 'timid men, office hunters, monocrats,
speculators and plunderers'</i> which he has missed no opportunity to
bestow upon them." (<i>Washington Federalist</i>, Feb. 12, 1801.)</p></div>

The letter as published in America, although it had undergone three
translations (from English into Italian, from Italian into French,
and from French into English again), does not materially differ from
Jefferson's original.
</p><p>
It greatly angered the Federalist leaders. Jefferson calls the Federalists
"an Anglican, monarchical &amp; aristocratical party." The
Republicans had "the landed interests and men of talent"; the Federalists
had "the Executive, the Judiciary," the office-holders and office-seekers&mdash;"all
timid men who prefer the calm of despotism to the
boisterous sea of liberty, British merchants &amp; Americans trading on
British capital, speculators &amp; holders in the banks &amp; public funds, a
contrivance invented for the purposes of corruption," etc.
</p><p>
Jefferson thus refers to Washington: "It would give you a fever
were I to name to you the apostates who have gone over to these
heresies, men who were Samsons in the field &amp; Solomons in the council,
but who have had their heads shorn by the whore England." It was
this insult to Washington which Marshall resented most bitterly.
</p><p>
Jefferson must have known that Mazzei would probably publish this
letter. Writing at Paris, in 1788, of Mazzei's appointment by the
French King as "intelligencer," Jefferson said: "The danger is that
he will overact his part." (Jefferson to Madison, July 31, 1788; <i>Works</i>:
Ford, v, 425.)
</p><p>
The Republicans frankly defended the Mazzei letter; both its facts
and "predictions" were correct, said the <i>Aurora</i>, which found scarcely
"a line in it which does not contain something to admire for elegance
of expression, striking fact, and profound and accurate penetration."
(<i>Aurora</i>, May 26, 1800.)</p></div>

Jan. 21, 25, and Feb. 6, 1801.
</p><p>
The following extracts from the first of these articles reveal the
temper and beliefs of the Federalists: "Burr never <i>penned</i> a declaration
of independence; ... but he ... has <i>engraved that declaration</i> in
<i>capitals</i> with the point of his sword: It is yet <i>legible</i> on the <i>walls of
Quebeck</i>. He has <i>fought</i> for that <i>independency</i>, for which Mr. <i>Jefferson</i>
only <i>wrote</i>. <i>He</i> has gallantly exposed his life in support of that
declaration and for the <i>protection</i> of its <i>penn-man</i>. He has been <i>liberal</i>
of his <i>blood</i>, <i>while</i> Mr. <i>Jefferson</i> has <i>only hazarded</i> his <i>ink</i>....
</p><p>
"<i>He never shrank from the post of danger.</i> <i>He</i> is <i>equally fitted for</i>
service in the <i>field</i> and in the <i>public counsels</i>: He has been <i>tried</i> in
<i>both</i>: in the one we have seen him <i>an able and distinguished Senator</i>;&mdash;in
the <i>other</i> a <i>brave</i> and <i>gallant officer</i>....
</p><p>
"<i>Mr. Jefferson</i> is better qualified to give the description of a butterfly's
wing or to write an essay on the bones of the Mammouth; ...
but Mr. Burr ... in ... knowledge ... necessary to form the <i>great
and enlightened statesman</i>, is <i>much superior</i> to Mr. Jefferson....
</p><p>
"Mr. Burr is not ... <i>consecrated</i> to the <i>French</i>; ... nor has he
unquenchable hatred to ... Great Britain. Unlike the <i>penn-man</i> of
the declaration he feels the <i>full force</i> of the expression, 'in <i>war enemies</i>,
in <i>peace friends</i>'... Mr. Burr ... will <i>only</i> consult <i>national honor</i> and
<i>national</i> happiness, having no improper passions to gratify.
</p><p>
"Mr. Burr is ... a friend of the Constitution ... a friend of the
commercial interests ... the firm and decided friend of the <i>navy</i> ...
the <i>Eastern</i> States have had a President and Vice President; So have
the <i>Southern</i>. It is proper that the <i>middle</i> states should also be respected....
</p><p>
"Mr. Burr has never procured or encouraged those infamous Calumnies
against those who have filled the Executive departments ... which we long have witnessed: Nor have those polluted <i>Sinks</i>, the
Aurora, the Argus, the Press, the Richmond Examiner, and the like,
poured forth their <i>impure</i> and <i>f&#339;tid streams</i> at the influence of Mr.
Burr, or to subserve his vanity or his ambition.
</p><p>
"If Mr. Burr is elected, the <i>Federalists</i> have nothing to <i>fear</i>....
The vile calumniators ... of all who have ... supported our government,
and the <i>foreign incendiaries</i>, who, having no interest in <i>Heaven</i>,
have called <i>Hell</i> to their assistance, ... from Mr. Burr have nothing
to <i>hope</i>....
</p><p>
"Mr. Burr can be raised to the Presidency without any <i>insult</i> to the
feelings of the Federalists, the friends of Government; ... <span class="smcap">without</span>
an <i>insult</i> to the <i>Memory</i> of <i>our</i> Washington; for it was not by
Mr. <i>Burr</i>, nor was it by <i>his</i> friends, nor to <i>serve him that the great, the
good, the immortal</i> Washington was charged with having, by his name,
given a sanction to corruption, with being meanly jealous of the fame
of even that contemptible wretch Tom Paine, with being an unprincipled
Hypocrite and with being a foul murderer! a murderer under
circumstances of such peculiar atrocity as to shock with horror the
merciless savages, and to cause them indignantly to fly from his blood
polluted banner!"</p></div>

in <i>Richmond Examiner</i>, Feb. 24, 1801.) There is no proof of
Callender's assertion; but some of the matter appearing in the <i>Washington
Federalist</i> is characteristic of Marshall's style and opinions.
See, for instance, the editorial on the prosecution of Theodore Dwight,
denouncing "party spirit" (<i>Washington Federalist</i>, March 1, 1801).
The <i>Aurora</i> of March 26, 1801, denounced "John Marshall's Federal

Jan. 6, 1801, stated this position with great ability. The argument is
able and convincing; and it is so perfectly in Marshall's method of
reasoning and peculiar style of expression that his authorship would
appear to be reasonably certain.
</p><p>
"Horatius's" opinion concluded that the power of Congress "is
completely adequate ... to provide by law for the vacancy that may
happen by the removal of both President and Vice President on the
3d of March next, and the non-election of a successor in the manner

Examiner</i>; reprinted in the <i>Aurora</i>, Feb. 9, 1801. George
Hay, the writer of this letter, was a lawyer in Richmond. Jefferson
appointed him United States Attorney for the District of Virginia,
and, as such, he conducted the prosecution of Aaron Burr for treason
before John Marshall, who, as Chief Justice of the United States,
presided at the trial. (See vol. <span class="smcap">iii</span> of this work.)
</p><p>
Marshall was again attacked in two open letters, signed "Lucius,"
in the <i>Richmond Examiner</i>, Feb. 10, 13, 1801. His reported opinion,
said "Lucius," alarmed "the active friends of freedom"; Marshall was
"the Idol of his party" and knew the influence of his views: unless he
publicly disclaimed the one now attributed to him, "Lucius" proposed
to "unveil" Marshall's "motives" and "expose" him "uncovered

Republicans were chiefly alarmed because, in the extension of the
National Judiciary, offices would be provided for Federalists. Even
Jefferson then saw nothing but patronage in the Judiciary Act.
</p><p>
The "evident" purpose of the bill, said the <i>Aurora</i>, Feb. 4, 1801,
was to "increase the influence of the present Executive and provide
a <i>comfortable retreat</i> for some of those <i>good federalists</i> who have found
it convenient to resign from their offices or been dismissed from them
by the people."
</p><p>
In comparison to this objection little attention was paid to the more
solid ground that the National Judiciary would be used to "force the
introduction of the common law of England as a part of the law of the
United States"; or even to the objection that, if the Judiciary was
extended, it would "strengthen the system of terror by the increase of
prosecutions under the Sedition law"; or to the increase of the "enormous
influence" given the National Courts by the Bankruptcy Law.
</p><p>
The <i>Aurora</i>, March 18, 1801, sounded the alarm on these and other
points in a clanging editorial, bidding "<i>the people beware</i>," for "the
hell hounds of persecution may be let loose ... and the people be
<span class="smcap">roasted</span> into implicit acquiescence with every measure of the 'powers
that be.'" But at this time it was the creation of offices that the
Federalists would fill to which the Republicans chiefly objected.</p></div>

pretext to assail Marshall, complained of his having procured the
appointment of relatives to the Judiciary establishment. "Mr. John
Marshall has taken particular care of his family," writes Jefferson's
newspaper hack, in a characteristically partisan attack upon Adams's
judicial appointments. (Scots Correspondent, in <i>Richmond Examiner</i>,
March 13, 1801.)
</p><p>
Joseph Hamilton Davies, a brother-in-law of Marshall's, was appointed
United States Attorney for the District of Kentucky; George
Keith Taylor, another brother-in-law, was appointed United States
Judge of the Fourth Circuit; and Marshall's brother, James M. Marshall,
was appointed Assistant Judge of the Territory (District) of
Columbia. These appointments were made, however, before the new
Judiciary Act was passed. (Executive Journal of the Senate, i, 357,
381, 387.) Callender appears to have been the only person to criticize
these appointments. Even Jefferson did not complain of them
or blame Marshall for them. The three appointees were competent
men, well fitted for the positions; and their appointment, it seems,
was commended by all.</p></div>

not have its effect, except in life appointments [judges] which are
irremovable." (Jefferson to Knox, March 27, 1801; <i>Works</i>: Ford,

authority of Jefferson's great-granddaughter. Yet this third-hand
household gossip has been perpetuated by serious historians. The
only contemporary reference is in the address of John Fowler of
Kentucky to his constituents published in the <i>Aurora</i> of April 9,
1801: "This disgraceful abuse was continued to the latest hour of
the President's holding his office." The "shameful abuse" was thus
set forth: "It [Judiciary Law of 1801] creates a host of judges, marshalls,
attorneys, clerks, &amp;c., &amp;c., and is calculated, if it could endure, to
unhinge the state governments and render the state courts contemptible,
while it places the courts of law in the hands of creatures of
those who have lost the confidence of the people by their misconduct.
The insidiousness of its design has been equalled only by the
shameless manner of its being carried into execution. The Constitution
disables any member of Congress from filling an office created
during his period of service. The late President [Adams] removed
persons from other branches of the Judiciary, to the offices created
by this law &amp; then put members of Congress into the thus vacated
offices.... This law can be considered in no other light than as
providing pensions for the principals and adherents of a party [Federalist].
The evil however will not I trust be durable and as it was
founded in fraud the return of a wiser system will release the country
from the shame and imposition." (Fowler to his constituents in
the <i>Aurora</i>, April 9, 1801.)</p></div>

<h3><a name="II" id="II"></a>II. GENERAL MARSHALL'S ANSWER TO AN ADDRESS<br />
OF THE CITIZENS OF RICHMOND, VIRGINIA</h3>

<p>I will not, Gentlemen, attempt to describe the emotions
of joy which my return to my native country, and particularly
to this city, has excited in my mind; nor can I paint the sentiments
of affection and gratitude towards you which my
heart has ever felt, and which the kind and partial reception
now given me by my fellow citizens cannot fail to increase.
He only who has been ... absent from a much loved country,
and from friends greatly and deservedly esteemed&mdash;whose
return is welcomed with expressions, which, di[rec]ted by
friendship, surpass his merits or his ho[pes,] will judge of feelings
to which I cannot do justice.</p>

<p>The situation in which the late Envoys from [the] United
States to the <i>French Republic</i> found themselves in <i>Paris</i> was,
indeed, attended with the unpleasant circumstances which
you have traced.&mdash;Removed far from the councils of their
country, and receiving no intelligence concerning it, the
scene before them could not fail to produce the most anxious
and disquieting sensations. Neither the ambition, the power,
nor the hostile temper of <i>France</i>, was concealed from them; nor
could they be unacquainted with the earnest and unceasing
solicitude felt by the government and people of the <i>United
States</i> for peace. But midst these difficulties, they possessed,
as guides, clear and explicit instructions, a conviction of the
firmness and magnanimity, as well as of the justice and pacific
temper of their government, and a strong reliance on that
patriotism and love of liberty, which can never cease to glow
in the American bosom. With these guides, however thorny
the path of duty might be, they could not mistake it. It
was their duty, unmindful of personal considerations, to pursue
peace with unabating zeal, through all the difficulties with
which the pursuit was embarrassed by a haughty and victorious
government, holding in perfect contempt the rights of
others, but to repel, with unhesitating decision, any propositions,
an acceptance of which would subvert the independence
of the <i>United States</i>.&mdash;This they have endeavoured to do. I
delight to believe that their endeavours have not dissatisfied
their government or country, and it is most grateful to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
mind to be assured that they receive the approbation of my
fellow-citizens in <i>Richmond</i>, and its vicinity.</p>

<p>I rejoice that I was not mistaken in the opinion I had formed
of my countrymen. I rejoice to find, though they know how
to estimate, and therefore seek to avoid the horrors and dangers
of war, yet they know also how to value the blessings of
liberty and national independence:&mdash;They know that peace
would be purchased at too high a price by bending beneath a
foreign yoke, and that peace so purchased could be but of
short duration. The nation thus submitting would be soon
involved in the quarrels of its master, and would be compelled
to exhaust its blood and its treasure, not for its own liberty,
its own independence, or its own rights, but for the aggrandizement
of its oppressor. The modern world unhappily exhibits
but too plain a demonstration of this proposition. I pray
heaven that <i>America</i> may never contribute its still further
elucidation.</p>

<p>Terrible to her neighbors on the continent of <i>Europe</i>, as all
must admit <i>France</i> to be, I believe that the <i>United States</i>, if
indeed united, if awake to the impending danger, if capable
of employing their whole, their undivided force&mdash;are so situated
as to be able to preserve their independence. An immense
ocean placed by a gracious Providence, which seems
to watch over this rising empire, between us and the European
world, opposes of itself such an obstacle to an invading
ambition, must so diminish the force which can be brought
to bear upon us, that our resources, if duly exerted, must be
adequate to our protection, and we shall remain free if we do
not deserve to be slaves.</p>

<p>You do me justice, gentlemen, when you suppose that consolation
must be derived from a comparison of the Administration
of the American Government, with that which I have
lately witnessed. To a citizen of the <i>United States</i>, so familiarly
habituated to the actual possession of liberty, that he almost
considers it as the inseparable companion of man, a view
of the despotism, which borrowing the garb and usurping the
name of freedom, tyrannizes over so large and so fair a proportion
of the earth, must teach the value which he ought to
place on the solid safety and real security he enjoys at home.
In support of these, all temporary difficulties, however great,
ought to be encountered, and I agree with you that the loss of
them would poison and embitter every other joy; and that de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>prived
of them, men who aspire to the exalted character of
freemen, would turn with loathing and disgust from every
other comfort of life.</p>

<p>To me, gentlemen, the attachment you manifest to the government
of your choice affords the most sincere satisfaction.
Having no interests separate from or opposed to those of the
people, being themselves subject in common with others, to
the laws they make, being soon to return to that mass from
which they are selected for a time in order to conduct the affairs
of the nation, it is by no means probable that those who
administer the government of the <i>United States</i> can be actuated
by other motives than the sincere desire of promoting the real
prosperity of those, whose destiny involves their own, and
in whose ruin they must participate. Desirable as it is at all
times, a due confidence in our government, it is peculiarly so
in a moment of peril like the present, in a moment when the
want of that confidence must impair the means of self defence,
must increase a danger already but too great, and furnish, or
at least give the appearance of furnishing, to a foreign real
enemy, those weapons, which have so often been so successfully
used.</p>

<p>Accept, gentlemen, my grateful acknowledgments for your
kind expressions concerning myself, and do me the justice to
believe, that your prosperity, and that of the city of <i>Richmond</i>
and its vicinity, will ever be among the first wishes of my
heart.</p>

GENERAL MARSHALL</h3>

<br />
POLITICAL QUESTIONS</h4>

<p class="center">
<i>Addressed to General</i> MARSHALL <i>with his Answer thereto</i><br />
To J. MARSHALL, Esq.<br />
</p>


<p class="ralign">
<span class="smcap">Richmond</span>, Sept. 12.<br />
</p>
<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>Under a conviction that it will be of utility, should the answers
to the following questions be such as I anticipate, I state
them with a confidence of your readiness to give replies. They
will, at all events, greatly satisfy my mind.</p>

<p><i>1st.</i> Do you not in heart, and sentiment, profess yourself an
American&mdash;attached to the genuine principles of the Constitution,
as sanctioned by the will of the people, for their general
liberty, prosperity and happiness?</p>

<p><i>2d.</i> Do you conceive that the true interest and prosperity
of <i>America</i>, is materially, or at all, dependent upon an alliance
with any foreign nation? If you do, please state the causes,
and a preference, if any exists, with the reasons for that preference.</p>

<p><i>3d.</i> Are you in favor of an alliance, offensive and defensive,
with <i>Great Britain</i>? In fine, are you disposed to advocate any
other, or a closer connection with that nation, than exists at
the ratification of the treaty of 1794? If so, please state your
reasons.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i> By what general principles, in your view, have the
measures of our Administration and Government, in respect to
<i>France</i>, been consistent with true policy or necessity? And
could not the consequences have been avoided by a different
line of conduct on our part?</p>

<p><i>5th.</i> Are you an advocate for the Alien and Sedition Bills?
Or, in the event of your election, will you use your influence
to obtain a appeal of these laws?</p>

<h3>MARSHALL'S ANSWERS TO FREEHOLDER'S
QUESTIONS</h3>

<p class="ralign">
<span class="smcap">Richmond</span>, Sept. 20, '98.<br />
</p>
<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>I have just received your letter of yesterday, [<i>sic</i>] and shall
with equal candor and satisfaction, answer all your queries.
Every citizen has a right to know the political sentiments of the
man who is proposed as his representative; and mine have never
been of a nature to shun examination. To those who think
another gentleman more capable of serving the district than
myself, it would be useless to explain my opinions because
whatever my opinions may be, they will, and ought, to vote
for that other; but I cannot help wishing that those who think
differently, would know my real principles, and not attribute
to me those I never possessed; and with which active calumny
has been pleased to asperse me.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. In heart and sentiment, as well as by birth and interest,
I am an American, attached to the genuine principles
of the constitution, as sanctioned by the will of the people,
for their general liberty, prosperity and happiness. I consider
that constitution as the rock of our political salvation, which
has preserved us from misery, division and civil wars; and
which will yet preserve us if we value it rightly and support
it firmly.</p>

<p><i>2.</i> I do not think the interest and prosperity of America, at
all dependent on the alliance with any foreign nation; nor does
the man exist who would regret more than myself the formation
of such an alliance. In truth, America has, in my opinion,
no motive for forming such connection, and very powerful
motives for avoiding them. Europe is eternally engaged
in wars in which we have no interest; and with which the fondest
policy forbids us to intermeddle.</p>

<p>We ought to avoid any compact which may endanger our
being involved in them. My sentiments on this subject are
detailed at large in the beginning of the memorial addressed
by the late envoys from the United States to the minister of
foreign affairs of the French Republic, where the neutrality
of the United States is justified, and the reasons for that neutrality
stated.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i> I am not in favor of an alliance offensive and defensive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
with Great Britain nor for closer connection with that nation
than already exists. No man in existence is more decidedly
opposed to such an alliance, or more fully convinced of the
evils that would result from it. I never have, in thought, word,
or deed, given the smallest reason to suspect I wished it; nor
do I believe any man acquainted with me does suspect it.
Those who originate and countenance such an idea, may (if
they know me) design to impose on others, but they do not impose
on themselves.</p>

<p>The whole of my politics respecting foreign nations are reducible
to this single position. We ought to have commercial
intercourse with all, but political ties with none. Let us buy
cheap and sell as dear as possible. Let commerce go wherever
individual, and consequently national interest, will carry it;
but let us never connect ourselves politically with any nation
whatever.</p>

<p>I have not a right to say, nor can I say positively, what are
the opinions of those who administer the Government of the
United States; but I believe firmly that neither the President,
nor any one of those with whom he advises, would consent
to form a close and permanent political connection with any
nation upon earth.</p>

<p>Should France continue to wage an unprovoked war against
us, while she is also at war with Britain, it would be madness
and folly not to endeavor to make such temporary arrangements
as would give us the aid of the British fleets to prevent
our being invaded; but I would not, even to obtain so obvious
a good, make such a sacrifice as I think we should make, by
forming a permanent political connection with that, or any
other nation on earth.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i> The measures of the administration and government
of the United States with respect to France have in my opinion
been uniformly directed by a sincere and unequivocal
desire to observe, faithfully, the treaties existing between the
two nations and to preserve the neutrality and independence
of our country.&mdash;Had it been possible to maintain peace with
France without sacrificing those great objects, I am convinced
that our government would have maintained it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it has been impossible. I do not believe that
any different line of conduct on our part, unless we would
have relinquished the rights of self government, and have become
the colonies of France, could have preserved peace with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
that nation.&mdash;But be assured that the primary object of
France is and for a long time past has been, dominion over
others. This is a truth only to be disbelieved by those who shut
their eyes on the history and conduct of that nation.</p>

<p>The grand instruments by which they effect this end, to
which all their measures tend, are immense armies on their
part, and divisions, which a variety of circumstances have enabled
them to create, among those whom they wish to subdue.
Whenever France has exhibited a disposition to be just toward
the United States, an accurate attention to facts now in possession
of the public, will prove that this disposition was manifest
in the hope of involving us in her wars, as a dependent
and subordinate nation.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i> I am not an advocate for the alien and sedition bills;
had I been in Congress when they passed, I should, unless
my judgment could have been changed, certainly have opposed
them. Yet, I do not think them fraught with all those mischiefs
which many gentlemen ascribe to them. I should have
opposed them because I think them useless; and because they
are calculated to create unnecessary discontents and jealousies
at a time when our very existence, as a nation, may depend
on our union&mdash;</p>

<p>I believe that these laws, had they been opposed on these
principles by a man, not suspected of intending to destroy the
government, or being hostile to it, would never have been enacted.
With respect to their repeal, the effort will be made before
I can become a member of Congress.</p>

<p>If it succeeds there will be an end of the business&mdash;if it
fails, I shall on the question of renewing the effort, should I
be chosen to represent the district, obey the voice of my constituents.
My own private opinion is, that it will be unwise
to renew it for this reason: the laws will expire of themselves,
if I recollect rightly the time for which they are enacted, during
the term of the ensuing Congress. I shall indisputably
oppose their revival; and I believe that opposition will be more
successful, if men's minds are not too much irritated by the
struggle about a repeal of laws which will, at the time, be expiring
of themselves.</p>
